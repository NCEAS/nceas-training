## Logic Models

In this session, we will:

- Learn about Logic Models
- Review the 'Tearless Method' for Logic Models
- Apply the principles of Logic Models to synthesis development

### Logic Models

Logic models are a planning tool that are designed to support program development by depicting the flow of resources and processes leading to a desired result. They are also used for outcomes-based evaluation of a program and are often requested as part of an evaluation planning process by funders or stakeholders.  

A simplified logic models comprise three main parts: Inputs, Outputs and Outcomes.

- Inputs: Resources, contributions, and investments required for a program;
- Outputs: Activities conducted, participants reached, and products produced; and
- Outcomes: Results or expected changes arising from the program 

Defining the inputs, outputs and outcomes early in a planning process enables teams to visualize the workflow from activity to results and can help mitigate potential challenges. The process of Logic modeling can also allow for assessing feasibility of a program.
