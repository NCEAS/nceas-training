###Guidelines to consider for curriculum development.
1. A single R Markdown (rmd) file per lesson.
2. Keep all files within a topically named folder here.
3. Use a folder with same name as rmd lesson to source supporting materials.
4. Keep all materials (when possible) within this ecosystem.
5. Even if your lesson is outside an rmd file, please prep an rmd.
6. Within each rmd, please include the following sections: introduction, learning outcomes, and summary. Then use added sections as needed depending on less.
