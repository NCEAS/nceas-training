        "\n",
        "2. **Use imperative tense**: Write commit messages in the imperative tense, as if giving a command. For example, use \"Add feature\" instead of \"Added feature\" or \"Adding feature.\" This convention aligns with other Git commands and makes the messages more actionable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Separate subject and body**: Start with a subject line, followed by a blank line, and then provide a more detailed explanation in the body if necessary. The subject line should be a short, one-line summary, while the body can provide additional context, motivation, or details about the changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Limit the subject line length**: Keep the subject line within 50 characters or less. This ensures that the commit messages are easily scannable and fit well in tools like Git logs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Capitalize and punctuate properly**: Begin the subject line with a capital letter and use proper punctuation. This adds clarity and consistency to the commit messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Focus on the \"what\" and \"why\"**: Explain what changes were made and why they were made. Understanding the motivation behind a commit helps future researchers and collaborators (including you!) comprehend its purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Use present tense for subject, past tense for body**: Write the subject line in present tense as it represents the current state of the codebase. Use past tense in the body to describe what has been done.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Reference relevant issues**: If the commit is related to a specific issue or task, include a reference to it. For example, you can mention the issue number or use keywords like \"Fixes,\" \"Closes,\" or \"Resolves\" followed by the issue number.\n",
