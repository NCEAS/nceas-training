## Branches

Branches are a mechanism to isolate a set of changes in their own thread, allowing multiple 
types of work to happen in parallel on a repository at the same time.  These are most often
used for separating work from multiple collaborators so they don't conflict, or trying out 
experimental work, or for managing bug fixes for historical releases of software. The default 
branch in most new repositories is called `main`, and it is the
branch that is typically shown in the GitHub interface and elsewhere.

```{mermaid}
%%{init: { 'theme': 'neutral' } }%%
gitGraph
    checkout main
    commit
    commit
    commit
```

The `main` branch of a repository is shown above with three commits, each representing one specific version of the repository linked to its parent commit.

But `main` isn't the only branch you can use in a repository. You can create more. Maybe you're not so sure that a new idea will work out in code, and this is where a tool like `Git` shines. Without a tool like `Git`, we might copy analysis.R to another file called analysis-ml.R which might end up having mostly the same code except for a few lines. This isn't particularly problematic until you want to make a change to a bit of shared code and now you have to make changes in two files, if you even remember to.

Instead, with `Git`, we can start a branch. Branches allow us to confidently experiment on our code, all while leaving the old code intact and recoverable.

```{mermaid}
%%{init: { 'theme': 'neutral' } }%%
gitGraph
    checkout main
    commit
    commit
    commit
    branch new-analysis-ml
    commit
    commit
```

So you've been working in a branch and have made a few commits on it and your boss emails again asking you to update the model in some way. If you weren't using a tool like `Git`, you might panic at this point because you've rewritten much of your analysis to use a different method but your boss wants the change to the old method.

But with `Git` and branches, we can continue developing our main analysis at the same time as we are working on any experimental branches. Using `git checkout main`, you can return the state of your working copy to the `main` branch, and make the needed change to the original code, all while saving the code in `new-analysis-ml` for later. Branches are great for experiments but also great for organizing your work generally, especially when each branch is tied to a ticket to discuss progress and issues on that line of work.

```{mermaid}
%%{init: { 'theme': 'neutral' } }%%
gitGraph
    checkout main
    commit
    commit
    commit
    branch new-analysis-ml
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    commit
```


After all that hard work on the machine learning experiment, you and your colleague could decide to scrap it. It's perfectly fine to leave branches around and switch back to the `main` line of development, but we can also delete them to tidy up.

If, instead, you and your colleague had decided you liked the machine learning experiment, you could also merge the branch with your `main` development line. Merging branches is analogous to accepting a change in Word's Track Changes feature but way more powerful and useful. With the merge, we take all of the changes from the branch, and apply them to the files in the target `main` branch (or whatever branch we are merging into). This might merge smoothly, or may generate a conflict that will need to be resolved if the same files had already been changed on `main`. Either way, when complete, there is a new `merge commit` showing where the two branches came together.

```{mermaid}
%%{init: { 'theme': 'neutral' } }%%
gitGraph
    checkout main
    commit
    commit
    commit
    branch new-analysis-ml
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    commit
    checkout new-analysis-ml
    commit
    checkout main
    merge new-analysis-ml tag: "final-paper-version"
    commit
```


A key takeaway here is that `Git` can drastically increase your confidence and willingness to make changes to your code and help you avoid problems down the road. Analysis rarely follows a linear path and we need a tool that respects this. The key to that confidence, however, is in understanding what git does with your versions, and how to get back to a previous state when needed.

Finally, imagine that, years later, your colleague asks you to make sure the model you reported in a paper you published together was actually the one you used. Another really powerful feature of `Git` is tags which allow us to label a particular version of our code with a meaningful name. In this case, we are lucky because we tagged the version of our code we used to run the analysis at the time the paper was submitted. Even if we continued to develop beyond last commit (above) after we submitted our manuscript, we can always go back and run the analysis as it was in the past.

### Exercise

Create a new branch in your training repository called `new-feature`, and then make 
changes to the RMarkdown files in the directory.  Commit and push those changes
to the branch. Now you can switch between branches using the GitHub interface.

This can be done directly in the RStudio interface within the `Git` pane using the new branch icon. Alternatively, you can run this line in the Terminal which will create a new branch and switch to it: ```git checkout -b new-feature```  

![](images/git-worfklows-new-branch-button.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}

After you click that icon, a new dialog box appears where you can create a new branch. Keep the setting to "origin" and keep the box "Sync branch with remote" checked.

![](images/git-workflows-new-branch.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}

You can now work on the `new-feature` branch in this new workspace independently of the codebase in `main`, and without affecting it. When you have finished and completed your changes, you can either decide to leave it there, delete it, or merge it back to main. To merge this new feature branch back, first checkout the main branch with `git checkout main`, and make a change to one of the files in your main branch -- commit that change, and you will see how you can have different changes stored in different branches. Your repository history should look something like this:

![](images/git-workflows-two-branches.png)

When you are ready to merge the feature branch back into `main`, all you have to do is run `git merge new-feature` from the commandline. After that is complete, your new feature will now be merged back into main and visible from the git history:

## Pull requests

We've shown in other chapters how to directly collaborate on a repository with
colleagues by granting them `write` privileges as a collaborator to your repository.
This is useful with close collaborators, but also grants them tremendous latitude to
change files and analyses, to remove files from the working copy, and to modify all
files in the repository.  

Pull requests represent a mechanism to more judiciously collaborate, one in which 
a collaborator can suggest changes to a repository, the owner and collaborator can 
discuss those changes in a structured way, and the owner can then review and accept
all or only some of those changes to the repository.  This is useful with open source
code where a community is contributing to shared analytical software, to students in 
a lab working on related but not identical projects, and to others who want the 
capability to review changes as they are submitted.

To use pull requests, the general procedure is as follows.  The collaborator first
creates a `fork` of the owner's repository, which is a cloned copy of the original
that is linked to the original.  This cloned copy is in the collaborator's GitHub
account, which means they have the ability to make changes to it.  But they don't have
the right to change the original owner's copy.  So instead, they `clone` their GitHub
copy onto their local machine, which makes the collaborator's GitHub copy the `origin`
as far as they are concerned. In this scenario, we generally refer to the Collaborator's
repository as the remote `origin`, and the Owner's repository as `upstream`.

![](images/github-workflows-fork.png)

Pull requests are a mechanism for someone that has a forked copy of a repository 
to **request** that the original owner review and pull in their changes.  This 
allows them to collaborate, but keeps the owner in control of exactly what changed.

## Exercise: Create and merge pull requests

In this exercise, work in pairs.  Each pair should create a `fork` of their partner's
training repository, and then clone that onto their local machine.  Then they can make changes
to that forked repository, and, from the GitHub interface, create a pull request that the
owner can incorporate. We'll walk through the process from both the owner and the collaborator's
perspectives.  In the following example, `mbjones` will be the repository owner, and `metamattj`
will be the collaborator.

1. *Change settings (Owner)*: Edit the GitHub settings file for your `training-test` repository, and ensure that the collaborator does not have editing permission.  Also, be sure that all changes in your repository are committed and pushed to the `origin` server.

2. *Fork (Collaborator)*: Visit the GitHub page for the owner's GitHub repository on which you'd like
to make changes, and click the `Fork` button.  This will create a clone of that repository in your
own GitHub account.  You will be able to make changes to this forked copy of the repository, but 
you will not be able to make direct changes to the owner's copy. After you have forked the repository,
visit your GitHub page for your forked repository, copy the url, and create a new RStudio project
using that repository url.

3. *Edit README.md (Collaborator)*: The collaborator should make one or more changes to the README.md
file from their cloned copy of the repository, `commit` the changes, and `push` them to their forked copy. At this point, their local repo and GitHub copy both have the changes that they made, but the owner's repository
has not yet been changed. When you now visit your forked copy of the repository on GitHub, you will now see your change has been made, and it will say that `This branch is 1 commit ahead of mbjones:main.` 

![](images/git-pr-03-fork-changed.png)

4. *Create Pull Request (Collaborator)*: At this point, click the aptly named `Pull Request` button to create a pull request which will be used to ask that the *owner* pull in your changes to their copy.

![](images/git-pr-04-config-pr.png)

When you click `Create pull request`, provide a brief summary of the request, and a more detailed message to start a conversation about what you are requesting. It's helpful to be polite and concise while providing adequate context for your request. This will start a conversation with the owner in which you can discuss your changes, they can easily review the changes, and they can ask for further changes before the accept and pull them in.  The owner of the repository is in control and determines if and when the changes are merged.

![](images/git-pr-05-create-pr.png)

5. *Review pull request (Owner)*: The owner will get an email notification that the Pull Request was created, and can see the PR listed in their `Pull requests` tab of their repsoitory.

![](images/git-pr-06-pr-list.png)

The owner can now initiate a conversation about the change, requesting further changes. The interface indicates whether there are any conflicts with the changes, and if not, gives the owner the option to `Merge pull request`.

![](images/git-pr-07-pr-view.png)

6. *Merge pull request (Owner)*: Once the owner thinks the changes look good, they can click the `Merge pull request` button to accept the changes and pull them into their repository copy. Edit the message, and then click `Confirm merge`.

![](images/git-pr-08-pr-merge.png)

Congratulations, the PR request has now been merged into the owner's copy, and has been closed with a note indicating that the changes have been made.

![](images/git-pr-09-merged.png)

7. *Sync with owner (Collaborator)*: Now that the pull request has been merged, there is a 
new merge commit in the Owner's repository that is not present in either of the 
collaborator's repositories.  To fix that, 
one needs to pull changes from the `upstream` repository into the collaborator's local
repository, and then push those changes from that local repository to the collaborator's
`origin` repository.

To add a reference to the `upstream` remote (the repository you made your fork from), in the terminal, run:

`git remote add upstream https://GitHub.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git`

Then to pull from the main branch of the `upstream` repository, in the terminal, run: 

`git pull upstream main`

At this point, the collaborator is fully up to date.
