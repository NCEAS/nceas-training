## Tidy Data: Part 1

### Learning Objectives

-   Understand basics of relational data models aka tidy data
-   Learn how to design and create effective data tables

### Introduction

In this lesson we are going to learn what relational data models are, and how they can be used to manage and analyze data efficiently. Relational data models are what relational databases use to organize tables. However, you don't have to be using a relational database (like mySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, or Microsoft Access) to enjoy the benefits of using a relational data model. Additionally, your data don't have to be large or complex for you to benefit. Here are a few of the benefits of using a relational data model:

-   Powerful search and filtering
-   Handle large, complex data sets
-   Enforce data integrity
-   Decrease errors from redundant updates

#### Simple guidelines for data management {.unnumbered}

A great paper called 'Some Simple Guidelines for Effective Data Management' [@borer_simple_2009] lays out exactly that - guidelines that make your data management, and your reproducible research, more effective.

- Use a scripted program (like R!)

A scripted program helps to make sure your work is reproducible. Typically, point-and-click actions, such as clicking on a cell in a spreadsheet program and modifying the value, are not reproducible or easily explained. Programming allows you to both reproduce what you did, and explain it if you use a tool like Rmarkdown.


- Non-proprietary file formats are preferred (eg: csv, txt)

Using a file that can be opened using free and open software greatly increases the longevity and accessibility of your data, since your data do not rely on having any particular software license to open the data file. 

- Keep a raw version of data

In conjunction with using a scripted language, keeping a raw version of your data is definitely a requirement to generate a reproducible workflow. When you keep your raw data, your scripts can read from that raw data and create as many derived data products as you need, and you will always be able to re-run your scripts and know that you will get the same output.

- Use descriptive file and variable names (without spaces!)

When you use a scripted language, you will be using file and variable names as arguments to various functions. Programming languages are quite sensitive with what they are able to interpret as values, and they are particularly sensitive to spaces. So, if you are building reproducible workflows around scripting, or plan to in the future, saving your files without spaces or special characters will help you read those files and variables more easily. Additionally, making file and variables descriptive will help your future self and others more quickly understand what type of data they contain. 

- Include a header line in your tabular data files

Using a single header line of column names as the first row of your data table is the most common and easiest way to achieve consistency among files.

- Use plain ASCII text

ASCII (sometimes just called plain text) is a very commonly used standard for character encoding, and is far more likely to persist very far into the future than proprietary binary formats such as Excel.

The next three are a little more complex, but all are characteristics of the relational data model:

- Design tables to add rows, not columns
- Each column should contain only one type of information
- Record a single piece of data only once; separate information collected at different scales into different tables.

### Recognizing untidy data

Before we learn how to create a relational data model, let's look at how to recognize data that does not conform to the model.

#### Data Organization {-}

This is a screenshot of an actual dataset that came across NCEAS. We have all seen spreadsheets that look like this - and it is fairly obvious that whatever this is, it isn't very tidy. Let's dive deeper in to exactly **why** we wouldn't consider it tidy.

#### Multiple tables {-}

Your human brain can see from the way this sheet is laid out that it has three tables within it. Although it is easy for us to see and interpret this, it is extremely difficult to get a computer to see it this way, which will create headaches down the road should you try to read in this information to R or another programming language.

#### Inconsistent observations {-}

Rows correspond to **observations**. If you look across a single row, and you notice that there are clearly multiple observations in one row, the data are likely not tidy.

#### Inconsistent variables {-}

Columns correspond to **variables**. If you look down a column, and see that multiple variables exist in the table, the data are not tidy. A good test for this can be to see if you think the column consists of only one unit type.

#### Marginal sums and statistics {-}

Marginal sums and statistics also are not considered tidy, and they are not the same type of observation as the other rows. Instead, they are a combination of observations.
