- What is a flexdashboard?

Flexdashboard is another R package from RStudio that is built on top of R Markdown and Shiny. It allows you to create flexible, interactive dashboards using simple Markdown documents. Flexdashboards are designed to be easy to author, and they support a wide variety of visualizations and interactive components. You can incorporate Shiny widgets and functionality into flexdashboards, making it a powerful tool for creating interactive reports and dashboards that can be shared with others.

### Flexdashboard is for R Markdown Only

`flexdashboard` is only compatible with R Markdown documents, meaning we can't use Quarto markdown documents with it. And that's okay! Remember just because Quarto exists now, doesn't mean R Markdown is going away or won't be maintained - see [Yihui Xie's blog post *With Quarto Coming, is R Markdown Going Away? No.*](https://yihui.org/en/2022/04/quarto-r-markdown/).

If you're really invested in only using Quarto tools - [keep an eye on this discussion](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3271). Quarto developers are actively working on a dashboarding feature for Quarto too.

- How does it compare to Shiny? When should I make a flexdashboard?

It depends on what your final product needs to be and what skillset your team has!
