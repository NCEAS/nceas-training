## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

-   Introduce FAIR and CARE principles and the value it provides to data
-   Develop a FAIR and CARE lens that can be applied to your data-focused work
-   Evaluate the FAIRness and CAREness of your work and the work of others
    
## But first, a reproducibility activity using LEGO®

This activity is largely based on the LEGO® Metadata for Reproducibility game pack, which was developed by [Mary Donaldson](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1936-3499) and [Matt Mahon](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8950-8422).

- Did you find this a simple way to document your process?
- Was there anything you found difficult to capture?
- Did those replicating the builds find it straightforward to follow?
- Did you encounter any ambiguity in the instructions?

## The FAIR and CARE principles

The idea behind these principles is to increase access and usage of complex and large datasets for innovation, discovery, and decision-making. This means making data available to machines, researchers, Indigenous communities, policy makers, etc.

With the need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of
data, a group of diverse stakeholders from academia, funding agencies,
publishers and industry came together to jointly endorse measurable
guidelines that enhance the reusability of data (@wilkinson_fair_2016).
These guidelines became what we now know as the FAIR Data Principles.

Following the discussion about FAIR and incorporating activities and
feedback from the Indigenous Data Sovereignty network, the Global
Indigenous Data Alliance developed the CARE principles
(@carroll_operationalizing_2021). The CARE principles for Indigenous
Data Governance complement the more data-centric approach of the FAIR
principles, introducing social responsibility to open data management
practices.

### What is FAIR?

In facilitating use of data resources, the data stewardship community
have converged on principles surrounding best practices for open data
management One set of these principles is the [FAIR
principles](https://force11.org/info/guiding-principles-for-findable-accessible-interoperable-and-re-usable-data-publishing-version-b1-0/).
FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible.

**Findable**

-   Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and
    computers.

**Accessible**

-   Once someone finds the required data, they need to know how the data
    can be accessed.

**Interoperable**

-   The data needs to be easily integrated with other data for analysis,
    storage, and processing.

**Reusable**

-   Data should be well-described so they can be reused and replicated
    in different settings.

### What is CARE?

<!-- NEED to IMPROVE THIS DESCRIPTION -->

"The 'CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance' were developed by
the International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within the
Research Data Alliance) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples,
scholars, non-profit organizations, and governments
(@carroll_care_2020). They address concerns related to the people and
purpose of data. It advocates for greater Indigenous control and
oversight in order to share data on Indigenous Peoples' terms.

These principles are people and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial
role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination.
CARE details that the use of Indigenous data should result in tangible
benefits for Indigenous collectives through inclusive development and
innovation, improved governance and citizen engagement, and result in
equitable outcomes"

The CARE and FAIR principles complement each other, encouraging open and
other data movements to consider both people and purpose in their
advocacy and pursuits. The goal is that stewards and other users of
Indigenous data will 'Be FAIR and CARE (@carroll_care_2020).

governance. (The Global Indigenous Data Alliance, GIDA-global.org,

The CARE Principles stand for Collective benefits, Authority control,
Responsibility and Ethics.

**Collective Benefit**

-   Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable
    Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.

**Authority to Control**

-   Indigenous Peoples' rights and interests in Indigenous data must be
    recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered.
    Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing
    bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous
    lands, territories, resources, knowledge and geographical
    indicators, are represented and identified within data.

**Responsibility**

-   Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share
    how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples'
    self-determination and collective benefit. Accountability requires
    meaningful and openly available evidence of these efforts and the
    benefits accruing to Indigenous Peoples.

**Ethics**

-   Indigenous Peoples' rights and well being should be the primary
    concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data
    ecosystem.
