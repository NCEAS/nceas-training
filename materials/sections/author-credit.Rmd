### Authorship and Credit 

Navigating issues of intellectual property and credit can be a challenge, particularly for early career researchers. Open communication is critical to avoiding misunderstandings and conflicts. Talk to your coauthors and collaborators about authorship, credit, and data sharing early and often. This is particularly important when working with new collaborators and across lab groups or disciplines which may have divergent views on authorship and data sharing. If you feel uncomfortable talking about issues surrounding credit or intellectual property, seek the advice or assistance of a mentor to support you in having these important conversations. 

The “Publication” section of the Ecological Society of America’s Code of Ethics is a useful  starting point for discussions about co-authorship, as are the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines for authorship and contribution. You should also check guidelines published by the journal(s) to which you anticipate submitting your work.

For collaborative research projects, develop an authorship agreement for your group early in the project and refer to it for each product. This authorship agreement from the Arctic Data Center provides a useful template. Some key questions to consider as you are working with your team to develop the agreement:

- What roles do we anticipate contributors will play? e.g., the CASRAI CRediT project identifies 14 distinct roles: 
    - Conceptualization
    - Data curation
    - Formal Analysis
    - Funding acquisition
    - Investigation
    - Methodology
    - Project administration
    - Resources
    - Software
    - Supervision
    - Validation
    - Visualization
    - Writing – original draft
    - Writing – review & editing
- What are our criteria for authorship? (See the ICMJE guidelines for potential criteria)
- Will we extend the opportunity for authorship to all group members on every paper or product?
- Do we want to have an opt in or opt out policy? (In an opt out policy, all group members are considered authors from the outset and must request removal from the paper if they don’t want think they meet the criteria for authorship)
- Who has the authority to make decisions about authorship? Lead author? PI? Group?
- How will we decide authorship order?
- In what other ways will we acknowledge contributions and extend credit to collaborators?
- How will we resolve conflicts if they arise?
