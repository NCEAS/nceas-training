## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:

- New mechanisms to collaborate using __git__
- What is a __Pull Request__ in Github?
- How top contribute code to colleague's repository using Pull Requests
- What is a __branch__ in git?
- How to use a branch to organize code
- What is a __tag__ in git and how is it useful for collaboration?

## Pull requests

We've shown in other chapters how to directly collaborate on a repository with
colleagues by granting them `write` privileges as a collaborator to your repository.
This is useful with close collaborators, but also grants them tremendous latitude to
change files and analyses, to remove files from the working copy, and to modify all
files in the repository.  

Pull requests represent a mechanism to more judiciously collaborate, one in which 
a collaborator can suggest changes to a repository, the owner and collaborator can 
discuss those changes in a structured way, and the owner can then review and accept
all or only some of those changes to the repository.  This is useful with open source
code where a community is contributing to shared analytical software, to students in 
a lab working on related but not identical projects, and to others who want the 
capability to review changes as they are submitted.

To use pull requests, the general procedure is as follows.  The collaborator first
creates a `fork` of the owner's repository, which is a cloned copy of the original
that is linked to the original.  This cloned copy is in the collaborator's GitHub
account, which means they have the ability to make changes to it.  But they don't have
the right to change the original owner's copy.  So instead, they `clone` their GitHub
copy onto their local machine, which makes the collaborator's GitHub copy the `origin`
as far as they are concerned. In this scenario, we generally refer to the Collaborator's
repository as the remote `origin`, and the Owner's repository as `upstream`.

Pull requests are a mechanism for someone that has a forked copy of a repository 
to **request** that the original owner review and pull in their changes.  This 
allows them to collaborate, but keeps the owner in control of exactly what changed.

## Exercise: Create and merge pull requests

In this exercise, work in pairs.  Each pair should create a `fork` of their partner's
training repository, and then clone that onto their local machine.  Then they can make changes
to that forked repository, and, from the GitHub interface, create a pull request that the
owner can incorporate. We'll walk through the process from both the owner and the collaborator's
perspectives.  In the following example, `mbjones` will be the repository owner, and `metamattj`
will be the collaborator.

1. *Change settings (Owner)*: Edit the github settings file for your `training-test` repository, and ensure that the collaborator does not have editing permission.  Also, be sure that all changes in your repository are committed and pushed to the `origin` server.

2. *Fork (Collaborator)*: Visit the GitHub page for the owner's GitHub repository on which you'd like
to make changes, and click the `Fork` button.  This will create a clone of that repository in your
own GitHub account.  You will be able to make changes to this forked copy of the repository, but 
you will not be able to make direct changes to the owner's copy. After you have forked the repository,
visit your GitHub page for your forked repository, copy the url, and create a new RStudio project
using that repository url.

3. *Edit README.md (Collaborator)*: The collaborator should make one or more changes to the README.md
file from their cloned copy of the repository, `commit` the changes, and `push` them to their forked copy. At this point, their local repo and github copy both have the changes that they made, but the owner's repository
has not yet been changed. When you now visit your forked copy of the repository on Github, you will now see your change has been made, and it will say that `This branch is 1 commit ahead of mbjones:master.`

4. *Create Pull Request (Collaborator)*: At this point, click the aptly named `Pull Request` button to create a pull request which will be used to ask that the *owner* pull in your changes to their copy.

![](images/git-pr-04-config-pr.png)

When you click `Create pull request`, provide a brief summary of the request, and a more detailed message to start a conversation about what you are requesting. It's helpful to be polite and concise while providing adequate context for your request. This will start a conversation with the owner in which you can discuss your changes, they can easily review the changes, and they can ask for further changes before the accept and pull them in.  The owner of the repository is in control and determines if and when the changes are merged.

5. *Review pull request (Owner)*: The owner will get an email notification that the Pull Request was created, and can see the PR listed in their `Pull requests` tab of their repsoitory.

![](images/git-pr-06-pr-list.png)

The owner can now initiate a conversation about the change, requesting further changes. The interface indicates whether there are any conflicts with the changes, and if not, gives the owner the option to `Merge pull request`.

![](images/git-pr-07-pr-view.png)

6. *Merge pull request (Owner)*: Once the owner thinks the changes look good, they can click the `Merge pull request` button to accept the changes and pull them into their repository copy. Edit the message, and then click `Confirm merge`.

![](images/git-pr-08-pr-merge.png)

Congratulations, the PR request has now been merged into the owner's copy, and has been closed with a note indicating that the changes have been made.

7. *Sync with owner (Collaborator)*: Now that the pull request has been merged, there is a 
new merge commit in the Owner's repository that is not present in either of the 
collaborator's repositories.  To fix that, 
one needs to pull changes from the `upstream` repository into the collaborator's local
repository, and then push those changes from that local repository to the collaborator's
`origin` repository.

To add a reference to the `upstream` remote (the repository you made your fork from), in the terminal, run:

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git`

Then to pull from the master branch of the `upstream` repository, in the terminal, run: 

`git pull upstream master`

At this point, the collaborator is fully up to date.

## Branches

Branches are a mechanism to isolate a set of changes in their own thread, allowing multiple 
types of work to happen in parallel on a repository at the same time.  These are most often
used for trying out experimental work, or for managing bug fixes for historical releases
of software.  Here's an example graph showing a `branch2.1` that has changes in parallel 
to the main branch of development:

![](images/version-graph.png)

The default branch in almost all repositories is called `master`, and it is the
branch that is typically shown in the GitHub interface and elsewhere.
There are many mechanisms to create branches.  The one we will try is 
through RStudio, in which we use the branch dialog to create and switch 
between branches.

### Exercise:

Create a new branch in your training repository called `exp-1`, and then make 
changes to the RMarkdown files in the directory.  Commit and push those changes
to the branch.  Now you can switch between branches using the github interface.
