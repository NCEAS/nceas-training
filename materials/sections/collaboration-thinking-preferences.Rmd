### Thinking preferences

#### Learning Objectives

Typically designed as an interactive group activity or ice breaker for collaborative teams, this unit will introduce you to variation in thinking preferences, allows for self assessment and reflection, and provides an exercise that can be used in a group setting.

#### About the Whole Brain Thinking System

Everyone thinks differently. The way individuals think guides the way they work, and the way groups of individuals think guides how teams work. Understanding thinking preferences facilitates effective collaboration and team work.

The [Whole Brain Model](https://www.thinkherrmann.com/how-it-works#core_idea), developed by Ned Herrmann, builds upon our understanding of brain functioning. For example, the left and right hemispheres are associated with different types of information processing and our neocortex and limbic system regulate different functions and behaviors.

The Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) provides insight into dominant characteristics based on thinking preferences. There are four major thinking styles that reflect the left cerebral, left limbic, right cerebral and right limbic.

- Analytical (Blue)
- Practical (Green)
- Relational (Red)
- Experimental (Yellow)

These four thinking styles are characterized by different traits. Those in the BLUE quadrant have a strong logical and rational side. They analyze information and may be technical in their approach to problems. They are interested in the 'what' of a situation. Those in the GREEN quadrant have a strong organizational and sequential side. They like to plan details and are methodical in their approach. They are interested in the 'when' of a situation.  The RED quadrant includes those that are feelings-based in their apporach. They have strong interpersonal skills and are good communicators. They are interested in the 'who' of a situation. Those in the YELLOW quadrant are ideas people. They are imaginative, conceptual thinkers that explore outside the box. Yellows are interested in the 'why' of a situation.

Most of us identify with thinking styles in more than one quadrant and these different thinking preferences reflect a complex self made up of our rational, theoretical self; our ordered, safekeeping self; our emotional, interpersonal self; and our imaginitive, experimental self.

Undertsanding the complexity of how people think and process information helps us understand not only our own approach to problem solving, but also how individuals within a team can contribute. There is great value in diversity of thinking styles within collaborative teams, each type bringing stengths to different aspects of project development.

#### Exercise: Your Complex Self {- .exercise}

Using the statements and guidance contained within this [document](files/ThinkingPreferencesMapping.pdf), plot the quadrilateral representing your complex self.

#### Group Thinking Preferences Activity {- .exercise}

You can use the steps below to guide a group through a process of exploring their thinking preferences. This work well in an in-person setting but can also be achieve online using technology that includes breakout rooms.

Step 1: Don't jump ahead in this document. (Did I just jinx it?)

Step 2: Review the [list of statements here](files/HBDIStatements.pdf) and reflect on your traits. Do you learn through structured activities? Are you conscious of time and are punctual? Are you imaginative? Do you like to take risks? 
Determine the three statements that resonate most with you and record them. Note the symbol next to each of them. 

Step 3: Review the [symbol key here](files/HBDIkey.pdf) and assign a color to each of your three remaining statements. Which is your dominant color or are you a mix of three?

Step 4: If in person, move through the space and talk to other team members about their dominant color statements. Keep moving until you cluster into a group of 'like' dominant colors. If you are a mix of three colors, find other group members that are also a mix. (If in a remote setting you can use the zoom breakout room feature to move between five pre-established breakout rooms).

Step 5: When the breakout groups/rooms have reached stasis, each group should note the name and dominant color of your breakout room. 

Step 6: Take a moment to reflect on one of the statements you selected and share with others in your group. Why do you identify strongly with this trait? Can you provide an example that illustrates this in your life?

Step 7: Regroup and discuss your perspectives around Tinking Preferences
