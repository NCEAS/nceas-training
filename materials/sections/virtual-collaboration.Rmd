## Virtual Collaboration

### Introduction

Collaborating virtually is an important part of modern research. We’ve all been thrown into virtual collaboration due to the COVID pandemic, but it was important prior and will continue to be in the future – likely moreso. Whether it’s with close colleagues from your local research group or new contacts from across the world, being able to collaborate virtually is a huge part of supporting people and increasing inclusion in research. And, the virtual environment provides new opportunities for reframing gatherings to prioritize people and connection over old rules or forms.  

This chapter focuses on virtual meetings, with points that are as relevant for one-on-ones as for meetings with many participants. Later on we’ll describe considerations for synchronous and asynchronous collaboration that complement virtual meetings but build from the points below.


### Set an inclusive tone

In virtual meetings it is critical to set an inclusive tone from the very beginning. This begins with having a clear purpose or goals for the event. 

**Welcome.** Schedule time at the very beginning to welcome folks, announce the meeting goals, and explain how to participate via community norms and software. Community norms for participation can be stated by summarizing the code of conduct and outlining shared expectations for the meeting. Participating with software can include tips about how to unmute microphones, use the chat, and write in a shared document. A good strategy to help earn buy-in and participation is to begin with a short roll call and icebreaker question that makes folks less anonymous and buffers time to accommodate connectivity issues.

**Agenda.** All meetings should have an agenda, the detail of which should match the weight of the meeting to maximize the time invested by all participants. When convening folks that don’t often meet, having a detailed agenda with specific minutes allotted to different topics (including the welcome!) is key. It should be designed to structure productive conversations while also providing enough flexibility to explore additional topics and strengthen relationships. If possible, the agenda should be shared ahead of time. If it’s a regular meeting, use the same document for each convening, putting the most recent date at the top of the document and take advantage of headers and table of contents to reduce scrolling. For low-key meetings with close collaborators, a time-allotting agenda might be less necessary but having clear shared expectations of process and outcomes can still be important. 

**Multiple communication channels.** Having multiple communication channels for folks to "speak up" during the meeting is important for underrepresented minorities, students, and early career people, as well as international or multi-lingual participants. Having multiple communication channels provides ways for folks to connect and catch up if folks join the call late or drop off due to connectivity issues. If you're using a shared document, writing feedback instead of verbalizing it can save time and also be used for side and asynchronous conversations.

**Modeled behavior.** Note that your behavior is a model for others and can have a big impact in setting the tone, particularly if you are a meeting lead or facilitator. A common pitfall of virtual meetings is that they are under-hosted or under-facilitated. Because we lack a lot of the contextual clues that we could get through language and space in virtual meetings, it is critical that there is orientation and modeled behavior to set the tone – a [generous authority](https://www.priyaparker.com/). See also the [meeting facilitation chapter][Collaboration Practices].


### Provide robust documentation

Documenting topics covered and decisions made during meetings is critical for reproducibility and inclusion – recurring themes for collaborative research in virtual or physical spaces, as well as a hybrid of the two. 

**Meeting notes.** Since people can log off from meetings with different perceptions and expectations, documentation can help keep people on the same page. Plus, documentation helps folks revisit ideas and action items, whether they were present at that meeting or not. Write meeting notes in a document—preferably in the agenda document mentioned above.

**Collaborative software.** Use collaborative document software such as Google Docs so that folks can take live notes together. Invite and teach participants how to contribute, and give them opportunities to get into the rhythm early on. For example, a written roll call at the beginning of the meeting invites people to be hands-on and can serve as a time buffer as folks arrive at the start.

**Shared effort.** Co-creating shared notes helps keep participants actively engaged. It also will result in a record of the meeting that is less brittle than anything produced by a single designated note-taker and will include more voices. Folks can contribute in many ways (including adding links, comments, +1's to affirm others' ideas, and emojis to provide quick emotion and color). Further, people can contribute to shared documents live during a meeting or asynchronously before and afterward. 


### Choose the right tools

Having appropriate communication channels for meetings is important because it can provide resilience when connections are dropped or links are requested. 

**Provide orientation.** Being deliberate about the tools you choose includes thinking about what tools they might already use and how to orient folks to this software. The tools you choose may require additional time – and empathy – to help everyone feel comfortable using the technology. Providing useful tips can help new and seasoned users alike improve their virtual experiences as versions update, for example “you can change your preferences so the video conferencing software doesn’t default to full-screen when someone screenshares: Preferences > Screen Share> Enter full screen when a participant shares screen > select your choice”.

**Video conferencing.** Video conferencing software allows participants to engage with "faces on." This is a nice norm to set to build engagement and camaraderie, and some software settings allow you to display 49 or more participant videos at once. When using video software it is important to state that it is fine to participate without enabling video for any reason, including bandwidth or privacy issues. Virtual backgrounds can be an option to increase privacy when having videos on.

**Breakout rooms.** Breakout rooms enable participants to have smaller conversations within a larger meeting. This can be a powerful way for more voices to be heard and can help move ideas forward and strengthen relationships and trust. Having prompts or tasks for breakout groups helps keep conversations focused. When scheduling breakout groups, it’s critical to also schedule time for each group to report-out or summarize their key insights once the whole group has reconvened. 

**Bandwidth considerations.** Choosing tools with limited bandwidth and resilience in mind can help meetings run smoothly. For example, instead of creating a presentation in a PowerPoint file that exists on only the presenter’s computer and is viewed via screensharing, consider creating it via Google Slides, sharing the link and asking participants to open the presentation on their computers and advance the slides themselves. Beyond reducing bandwidth issues, the hands-on engagement in this approach can also reduce passiveness that can arise as a result. 

**Collaborating with data and code.** There are tools, workflows, and norms for collaborating with data and code that are discussed in the [tools and skills chapter][Skills and Tools for Reproducible and Team Science]. These tools and practices help your most important collaborator – Future You – and also help you collaborate with others – current and Future Us. You can also use these tools in creative ways to help organize your project management and meetings without having to introduce new software (and user accounts): for example using GitHub Issues to brainstorm the agenda and topics to discuss.


### Synchronous and asynchronous 

It will not always be possible to convene everyone at your meeting that you’d like. Time zones, internet connectivity, family and other obligations, and other foreseen and unforeseen surprises can be challenges for all of us, despite the best intentions. The ideas we described above that focused on inclusion, robust documentation, and tools also provide ways for folks to participate asynchronously. Asynchronous collaboration occurs when folks aren’t all able to be synchronized in-time with the meeting.

We’re actually quite familiar with asynchronous collaboration in research: this is email. We know how to email with our collaborators, attaching different versions of data or analyses or manuscripts and expecting feedback, with an implicit or explicit deadline. Depending on the size of your collaboration or meeting, email chains may be too unruly or unstructured, and this is when these other tools and practices can help bolster combinations of synchronous and asynchronous collaboration. 

There are other creative ways to make synchronous and asynchronous collaboration work together. One example is of a “[marathon manuscript relay](https://www.esa.org/esablog/guest-posts/ecology-and-covid-4-leveraging-the-liabilities-of-virtual-collaboration/)” that an NCEAS working group ran early in 2020 to make progress on a draft manuscript. Smaller teams from three different time zones contributed during their normal work hours, passing their progress off to the next team. This required using collaborative software like Google Docs over Word documents so that everyone could participate in real-time. It also required additional documentation, time to summarize, and leadership within each team to synthesize progress and delegate next steps, along with norms within each team as to how often to have video calls or check in via chat. Despite the challenges, the focused effort of all working group members on the manuscript meant that they made much more progress than they would have emailing versions of Word documents to each other, going from a basic outline to full text with near-final figures during the relay.


### Considerations for scaling and audience sizes

The ideas presented above still hold true to scale meetings for different audience sizes –  to a point. As audience size increases above 50 or 100, it will be important to revisit the design, tools, and resources so that participants are able to fulfill the purpose of the event. For example, currently Google Docs/Slides/Sheets has trouble with more than 50 people contributing simultaneously, and there are limitations on Zoom breakout room size depending on cost-tiers and versions. Size will drive technology choices, and it will also drive human resources. As you scale, you will need more facilitators and “switchboard operators” (someone responsible for creating breakout groups and admitting from the waiting room, etc) to help things run smoothly.  

Additionally, at some point a meeting might become more of a conference, which requires more time, people, and tools to run effectively. There are many online resources available for convening conferences and [other creative virtual events](https://zenodo.org/record/3934385#.X8WD9ll7nUI), including [structured coffee time](https://www.esa.org/esablog/guest-posts/ecology-and-covid-4-leveraging-the-liabilities-of-virtual-collaboration/). 


### Planning tips 

Remember to give yourself enough planning time: give virtual meetings (at least) the same level of planning as in person meeting: twice the planning time compared with the duration. Prepare participants by circulating an agenda and pre-work in advance and hold them accountable for coming prepared. Start and end meetings on time, and remember that *how* you start the meeting (welcoming and measured vs abrupt or rushed) makes a difference. Keep shared goals in sight, track progress, check in frequently, and celebrate achievements. See additional details and resources about designing and facilitating effective meetings in the [meeting facilitation chapter][Collaboration Practices].


### Closing thoughts

It is hard to remotely recreate in-person experiences, including hallway conversations and chance connections in line for tea. But there are things that we can do really great remotely, and we should! Additionally, there are new software and features coming out all the time; including ones that try to help recreate informal and impromptu conversations. It takes intention, clear purpose, and good design, all of which are elements we can also carry forward to in-person and hybrid meetings in the future.
