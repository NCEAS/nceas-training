## Community Data

### Introduction

In this section of the training, we focus on **tools and approaches for
ethically managing community data in research projects and community
collaborations**.

**Community data** can be defined broadly as **any data that a community
feels a sense of investment in or ownership of** (Johnson et al. 2021;
Pulsifer et al. 2012). (In this workshop, we are using the term
“community” to refer to a geographic place and the people who live
there). Community data may include:

 * data produced by community-engaged or led research projects;  
 * data collected by external researchers that is about or relevant to
   a community or the people who live there;
 * or data or information needed to guide local decision-making and
   planning.

How does management of community data differ from traditional academic
approaches to data management? While many of the tools (such as data
management plans) are similar, community data management is guided by
ethical considerations and protocols discussed in the “data ethics”
part of this training. It has been said that data management is not
primarily technical but social; **ethical management of community data
requires significant attention to the processes of meaningful
collaboration needed to build and maintain relationships with
communities**. Community data management also requires an understanding
of the governance context, including ethics protocols. In addition,
building capacity and support for community control of data is an
important aspect of community data management. **ELOKA refers to these
three aspects (governance/application of tools/capacity building) as
comprising a “community data management system.”**


### Tools and Approaches for Stewardship of Community Data

#### Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

**An MOU is a formal agreement between two or more parties that
documents the nature of the relationship and collaboration and puts
into writing specific expectations regarding data management and data
ownership. [Although they are not legally binding](https://uas.alaska.edu/admin/mous-moas.html)**, they are formal
agreements to coordinate activities and as such, Universities may
require legal counsel to review an MOU. An MOU may be most useful when
a community or Tribe and a research program or institution want to lay
out terms for ongoing collaboration beyond the timeframe of a single
project, although sometimes a more formal agreement may be helpful to
establish clear expectations for cooperation at the project level.

**Some resources and templates for developing an MOU**:
