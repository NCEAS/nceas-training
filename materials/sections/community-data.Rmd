## Community Data

### Introduction

In this section of the training, we focus on **tools and approaches for
ethically managing community data in research projects and community
collaborations**.

**Community data** can be defined broadly as **any data that a community
feels a sense of investment in or ownership of** (Johnson et al. 2021;
Pulsifer et al. 2012). (In this workshop, we are using the term
“community” to refer to a geographic place and the people who live
there).

Community data may include:

 * data produced by community-engaged or led research projects;  
 * data collected by external researchers that is about or relevant to
   a community or the people who live there;  
 * or data or information needed to guide local decision-making and
   planning.

How does management of community data differ from traditional academic
approaches to data management? While many of the tools (such as data
management plans) are similar, community data management is guided by
ethical considerations and protocols discussed in the “data ethics”
part of this training. It has been said that data management is not
primarily technical but social; **ethical management of community data
requires significant attention to the processes of meaningful
collaboration needed to build and maintain relationships with
communities**. Community data management also requires an understanding
of the governance context, including ethics protocols. In addition,
building capacity and support for community control of data is an
important aspect of community data management. **ELOKA refers to these
three aspects (governance/application of tools/capacity building) as
comprising a “community data management system.”**


### Tools and Approaches for Stewardship of Community Data

#### Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

**An MOU is a formal agreement between two or more parties that
documents the nature of the relationship and collaboration and puts
into writing specific expectations regarding data management and data
ownership. [Although they are not legally binding](https://uas.alaska.edu/admin/mous-moas.html)**, they are formal
agreements to coordinate activities and as such, Universities may
require legal counsel to review an MOU. An MOU may be most useful when
a community or Tribe and a research program or institution want to lay
out terms for ongoing collaboration beyond the timeframe of a single
project, although sometimes a more formal agreement may be helpful to
establish clear expectations for cooperation at the project level.

#### Data Management Plan (DMP)

A DMP is a document used to **describe the strategies and tools you will
use to manage your data through different stages in the research
lifecycle, including data collection, documentation & metadata,
storage and backup, sharing & reuse, and preservation**. The DMP
includes plans for managing data both during active research as well
as after the project is complete. DMPs include information about:

 * what data will be created
 * what policies will apply to the data
 * who will own and have access to the data
 * what data management practices will be used
 * what facilities and equipment will be required
 * who will be responsible for each of these activities.

[https://dmptool.org/](https://dmptool.org/) is a free, online tool
developed by the California Digital Library to guide development of
DMPs. The template is customizable based on the funder that the plan
will be submitted to. They maintain a list of funder requirements as
well as a list of public plans from other projects - you can search
them by keyword, funder, institution, language, and subject. (At the
time of this training, a keyword search for “Indigenous” had only one
result). The tool does not (yet?) incorporate IDS/CARE principles. A
similar tool, [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/), is available from the Digital Curation
Centre.

**A data management plan should be developed during the planning phase
of a research project**. Many funders explicitly require a data
management plan as part of a funding proposal. As a result, DMPs are
often put together in haste to meet a proposal deadline without a lot
of thought about ethical management of data. These DMPs are then often
set aside without a lot more thought, and as a result there is a
missed opportunity to use DMPs to deeply consider data as one of the
major legacies of a research project, with the potential to “live”
well beyond the duration of the research project. **In the context of
collaborative research, data sharing and use have the potential to
create friction when they are viewed as supplementary rather than
integral to good project planning and implementation.**

![](images/2022-03_assw_cdm02.png)

Some elements of a DMP for co-produced research or research involving Indigenous Knowledge:

 * When Indigenous data is involved or when activities will be
   undertaken on or near Indigenous lands/waters, or when the data
   generated is relevant to Indigenous governance, the plan should
   include a discussion of Indigenous data sovereignty.  
 * This should include a statement of overall intent as well as a
   careful review of proposed activities to ensure that they uphold
   IDS principles, with reference to the relevant ethical guidelines
   including any foundational or mid-level frameworks as well as the
   CARE principles.  
 * The foundational guidelines at the Tribal or community level, if
   available, should serve as the primary resource for ethical data
   management.  
 * To be effective in the context of collaborative research, DMPs
   should be revisited at different stages of the project to make sure
   that all collaborators still feel comfortable with plans based on
   how the project has evolved.  

##### Case Study {- .aside}
The [Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Archive](https://www.atsida.edu.au/) (ATSIDA)
suggests that researchers working in the field of Australian
Indigenous Studies ask and answer (collaboratively with communities)
the following questions as part of data management planning (also
relevant to the Arctic community and Indigenous context):

 1. Do the participants want the data preserved?  
 2. Does any data need to be attributed to Traditional Knowledge holders?  
 3. What are the access and use constraints for data deposited?  
 4. How do I manage requests for re-use?  
 5. Do I need to make the data anonymous?  
 6. Can I publish the material online?  
 7. If material is closed to public access, how long for?
 8. Do I need to dispose of any research data? If so, have I deleted
 it adequately without leaving a digital footprint? (Gardiner and
 Thorpe 2014)


#### Data Use Agreement

![](images/2022-03_assw_cdm03.png)

**A data use agreement is a tool that asks users to agree to specific
requirements for use, such as providing context for the data, citing
the data in a certain way, and recognizing the rights of Indigenous
knowledge holders**. For example, the SIZONet/AAOKH database, a digital
database of community contributed observations about the coastal
environment in Alaska, includes a use agreement that provides a
citation for the dataset and asks users to acknowledge the individual
observer as well as review a paper providing additional context. In
order to access the observations, an atlas user must confirm that they
will abide by these use terms.


#### Data Citation

![](images/2022-03_assw_cdm04.png)

Giving proper recognition to the knowledge and data contributed by
Indigenous communities and Knowledge holders is an important part of
ethical data management. **When Indigenous data or community data is
shared in a digital format, for example in an online atlas or
database, it should be accompanied by a suggested citation**, which will
help those who access and use the data provide the proper credit.

 * Like all data citations, it should include a persistent identifier,
   such as a DOI. Data repositories will often assist with securing a
   DOI for a dataset when it is deposited.  
 * To address the challenges of providing context, the citation could
   be accompanied by a user guide that includes additional information
   that could be useful to understand or interpret the data/knowledge.

Lorisia McLeod of the James Smith Cree Nation developed templates for
citing Indigenous Elders and Knowledge Keepers in APA and MLA format
(Kornei 2021; McLeod 2021). The templates include the name of the
knowledge holder/keeper, nation/community, treaty territory (if
applicable), city/community they live in (if applicable), a brief
description or title of the teaching, personal communication (for the
APA template) and date (McLeod 2021).

##### Example (APA format): {- .aside}

Cardinal, D. Goodfish Lake Cree Nation. Treaty 6. Lives in Edmonton. Oral teaching. personal communication. April 4, 2004.

#### {-}

For digital data, this could be combined with additional information
that is commonly used in developing a data citation, such as:

 * Release date (for a complete dataset)  
 * Formal title of the dataset  
 * Version of the dataset (if updates are planned)  
 * Format of the data (physical format the data is in)  
 * Archive or distributor (location where the dataset is held)  


#### Metadata

Metadata supports data discovery, retrieval and reuse. When data are
made available for use, metadata provides a structured record that
allows users to locate data and understand how to use or
interpret it. Metadata records might contain information about how and
where the data or knowledge was collected and by whom, the storage
file type and how the data is organized.

##### Metadata questions to consider (from University of Michigan Library Research Guide): {-.aside}

 * What contextual details (metadata) are needed to make your data meaningful?  
 * What form or format will the metadata describing your data take?
   Which metadata University of Michigan Library Research Guild
   standards will you use? If there is no applicable standard, how
   will you describe your data in a way that will make them accessible
   to others?  
 * How will metadata files be generated for each of the data sets that
   you produce? Who will do the work of data description and how will
   the costs be borne?  
 * Who on your team will be responsible for ensuring that metadata
   standards are followed and are correctly applied to the
   corresponding data sets?  
   
#### {-}

Except when efforts have been made to update metadata, **much of the
metadata that describes Indigenous data in museum and library
collections uses outdated and racist terminology such as names that
were applied to Indigenous Peoples without their consent.** There have
been a number of efforts within the library and archival communities
to describe these challenges and develop approaches to address
them. For example **the [“Use Our Words” Toolkit](https://indigenouslis.ca/the-use-our-words-toolkit/) by Lauren Bourdages and
Kassandra Caporiccio provides an approach to reviewing metadata in
library and archive collections to decolonize the subject terms** used
to describe collections, replacing problematic terms with ones that
have been approved by Indigenous communities.

![](images/2022-03_assw_cdm05.png)

Metadata standards establish a common way of structuring and
understanding data. For Indigenous data, metadata description
standards need to have some flexibility so that communities can
determine what classes and terms should be used (Murphy
2019). **Metadata are information sources so IDS guidelines apply to
metadata** - it is important to collaborate fully on metadata
development with Indigenous community partners (Kukutai & Taylor). To
give an example of how this was applied in a project context: *The
Atlas of Community-Based Monitoring in a Changing Arctic*
(arcticcbm.org) is an online inventory of CBM and Indigenous Knowledge
projects. The atlas hosts only metadata and points users to other,
project-controlled sites when observational data records or datasets
are available. Nevertheless, permission to include projects was
obtained prior to adding each record in the atlas, even when the
metadata was already available on another online site.

Sharing metadata, or “data about data” is one way to uphold open
science principles when sharing data is not possible/ethical (ADC
2020). **The Arctic Data Center requests information about ethical
research practices as part of the metadata they ask projects to
submit**. They ask researchers to:

 * *Describe how and the extent to which data collection procedures
    followed community standards for ethical research practices (e.g.,
    CARE Principles).*  

 * *Be explicit about Institutional Review Board approvals, consent
    waivers, procedures for Co-production, data sovereignty, and other
    issues addressing responsible and ethical research.*  

 * *Include any steps to anonymize, aggregate or de-identify the
    dataset, or to otherwise create a version for public
    distribution.”*  

This is a new request but some early responses have required
back-and-forth to address questions and a general lack of awareness on
the part of some respondents that they should consider
community/Indigenous data interests and requirements in relation to
their research projects. For example, some respondents suggest that
there are no ethical requirements for their data because it did not
need to go through IRB review at their university, or because they do
not work directly in community settings or on tribally held
lands. These responses ignore the fact that **Arctic Indigenous
residents have historic homelands that extend over vast areas, well
beyond what is officially recognized as “Tribal lands.” Additionally,
research and data produced on adjacent lands or on topics with
relevance to Indigenous governance should still be made available to
communities.**

#### Traditional Knowledge Labels and Notices

![](images/2022-03_assw_cdm06.png)

The [TK Labels](https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/) were developed by the Local Contexts project as a way to
support the management of cultural heritage data in digital
environments. **The metadata labels are intended to be customized by
communities to reflect their particular rules and responsibilities in
relation to data sharing** (such as sacred and/or ceremonial material,
material that has gender restrictions, seasonal conditions of use
and/or materials specifically designed for outreach purposes. They can
be adapted by using the Local Contexts Hub. [TK Notices](https://localcontexts.org/notices/aboutnotices/) are also
available for use by **institutions and researchers to recognize
Indigenous interests in collections and data**. The notices can be used
to indicate openness to collaborate with a community on a particular
collection or dataset where there is not yet a label associated with
the content. These labels give researchers and other users more
information and ethical guidance about how a collection or dataset
should be used. The project has also developed [Biocultural](https://localcontexts.org/labels/biocultural-labels/) labels and
notices and is working on developing TK licenses.

speaking as part of AOS 2022 on the following panels:*

   Perspectives (Wednesday, March 30)

#### Digital Infrastructure

Increasingly, Indigenous and community data are stored in digital
formats and made available through web-based applications such as
online databases, portals, and atlases. To uphold IDS, **decisions about
where to store data and who should be able to access it should be made
by a governing body or organization within the community where the
data was collected** (Burrage 2020). Some projects establish a research
advisory committee to guide these types of decisions. **The selection of
digital tools to manage and share community data should also be made
with the informed input and guidance of community members**.

![](images/2022-03_assw_cdm07.png)

Digital data management and sharing tools range from basic websites to
applications designed with the aim of supporting Indigenous data
management (such as the [Mukurtu content management system](https://mukurtu.org/) for managing
cultural heritage or the [SIKU platform](https://siku.org/) that is designed to store and
share observational data from Arctic communities) to custom-built
tools that meet specific needs of a project or community (Johnson et
al. 2021). The selection of a tool requires consideration of a range
of factors including cost, functionality, and privacy and security of
data, among other things.

**To protect sensitive data, digital applications can employ a range of
techniques such as using password protection to limit access to all or
a portion of the data and creating public and private versions of an
application that display different datasets.** Another approach is to
create aggregated or less detailed datasets for public access while
providing full access to limited community users who are given
usernames and passwords to access the sites.


#### Long-term Storage and Archiving

Some communities have concerns about data being stored non-locally. In
other cases, there are no concerns about non-local data storage as
long as communities have ongoing access to data in usable
formats. **Enhancing community infrastructure so that communities are
able to manage their own data, such as through a locally maintained
server, is an important component of IDS.**

Data should be reviewed (by community members) for suitability for
long-term preservation. Part of this process is setting appropriate
access conditions. Some repositories allow partially open data, where
some data is open and other data requires special permission or is
closed. Access conditions can also limit access for a certain period
of time.

![](images/2022-03_assw_cdm08.png)

The [Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Archive](https://www.atsida.edu.au) has developed a
set of protocols that advocate for the return of data in a digital
form to the community at the end of the research project. This creates
the opportunity for active participation of community members in
decisions about deposit, access and use of the data (Gardiner & Thorpe
2014). They note that a lack of infrastructure and support in
communities to manage digital cultural heritage presents a challenge,
however. They have been testing the [Mukurtu content management system](https://mukurtu.org/)
as a tool to support digital repatriation.


#### Publishing

![](images/2022-03_assw_cdm09.png)

Many journals have open data requirements but also have exceptions for
data with legal/ethical considerations. **It is important to review a
journal’s data policies prior to deciding where to
submit/publish.** Keep in mind that apart from a few journals
specializing in Indigenous Knowledge, **the process of “peer review” of
academic papers does not include Indigenous Knowledge holders as
expert reviewers.** This creates significant challenges for IDS, since
Indigenous Knowledge systems have their own system of “review” based
on practical recognition of what works over time, as well as the
identification and recognition of “experts” in particular topics
within each community (Loseto et al. 2020).

Prior to submission in academic journals, **papers developed with
community and Indigenous collaborators should go through review within
the community to ensure that data was interpreted and attributed
correctly** and that the community feels comfortable with choices about
what is included and how all contributors and the community are
represented. Writing about this process as part of the methodology
will help orient the reviewers and readers to how this knowledge was
reviewed by the community’s process.

A growing list of journals focus on or accept “Data papers”-- short
papers that offer a description of datasets. This is an area of
publication where projects generating community and Indigenous data
could share information about their datasets to make them more visible
and also to raise awareness about access constraints and the reasons
for them in the context of the open science/open data movement.


#### Secondary Analysis of Indigenous Data

![](images/2022-03_assw_cdm10.png)

**There are different opinions about whether or not it is possible to
conduct secondary analysis of Indigenous data in a way that honors and
respects Indigenous research ethics.** Secondary analysis is done by
someone who was not the original researcher, so there are concerns
about the lack of relationship to the place and person/people/culture
in which the knowledge was produced. As Rachel Burrage notes:

“...if the creation of and sharing of knowledge is relational in
nature, this …calls into question the appropriateness of allowing a
third party to analyze knowledge that was created through a
relationship between the original researcher and the individual or
community that provided the original data” (Burrage 2020: 30).

On the other hand, Burrage says, many researchers who have conducted
research with or on Indigenous Peoples are not fully aware of the
cultural context and may not be any better positioned to correctly
interpret and provide context for data. It is also possible that
secondary analysis may be done by someone who is familiar with the
context (a community embedded researcher) but not the data (Burrage
2020).  **There may be benefits to secondary analysis for knowledge
holders and communities, including respecting and making the most of
the time that was already contributed by the individual who shared
their knowledge** (so that it does not have to be shared multiple times
for different research or knowledge documentation projects).

One way to recenter relationship in secondary analysis is to adopt a
**participatory approach that involves engaging community members from
the community where the data was collected in the data
reanalysis**. This allows their knowledge of context to inform the data
interpretation, and also potentially offers a community member the
chance to become familiar with data or knowledge that they may not
have seen before (such as a set of interviews with Elders) (Burrage
2020).

##### Burrage (2020) suggests that researchers considering secondary
analysis of Indigenous knowledge reflect on these questions: {- .aside}
Burrage (2020) suggests that researchers considering secondary
analysis of Indigenous knowledge reflect on these questions:

 * Was the original data collected in a way that is congruent with an
   Indigenous research paradigm?  
 * Has the data been stored and accessed according to principles of
   Indigenous data sovereignty?  
 * What is your relationship with the community where the data wa
   originally collected?  
 * How will you familiarize yourself with the epistemologies and
   ontologies of the community from which the data was drawn?  
 * Who might you turn to for assistance if you have questions about
   particular meanings within the data, both in terms of language and
   in terms of styles of speech?
 * How feasible will it be to receive feedback on your results from
   the community that provided the data?
 * How will you disseminate your results in a way that it reaches the
   community that provided the data?


### Summary: Life Cycle of Community Data

![](images/2022-03_assw_cdm11.png)

Working with community data across different stages of a project
follows many of the same practices of working with any data. This
image is an adaptation of the “Data Life Cycle” developed by DataONE,
focusing on some of the specific requirements of community data
management discussed today. In summary, data management should not be
taken for granted or addressed early in a project and then set
aside. Making data management part of the process of engagement that
is revisited throughout a project will support ethical management, use
and (when relevant) reuse of data.

### Discussion questions

What do you see as the benefits to your research (or to Arctic
research more generally) from applying the frameworks discussed today?
What do you see as the major impediments to adopting these frameworks
in the context of open science? How might you navigate these conflicts
within your own research project(s)?

Have you used any of the tools or approaches discussed in this session
to support management of community data in your projects? What has
worked well for you with these tools and where have you encountered
challenges? Are there any tools or approaches to ethical data
management that you have learned about today that are relevant to your
work and that you may apply in the future?
