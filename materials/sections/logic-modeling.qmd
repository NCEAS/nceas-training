## Logic Models

Logic models are a planning tool that is designed to support program development by depicting the flow of resources and processes leading to a desired result. They are also used for outcomes-based evaluation of a program and are often requested as part of an evaluation planning process by funders or stakeholders.

A simplified logic models comprise three main parts: Inputs, Outputs and Outcomes.

Inputs reflect ***what is invested***, outputs are ***what is done*** and outcomes are the ***results of the program***.

In a more detailed logic model, outputs and outcomes are further broken down. Outputs are often represented as 'Activities' and 'Participants'. By including participation (or participants), the logic model is explicitly considering the intended audience, or stakeholders, impacted by the program. Engagement of this audience is an output. In the case of outcomes, these can be split into short, medium and long-term outcomes. Sometimes this last category may be labeled 'Impact'

Defining the inputs, outputs and outcomes early in a planning process enables teams to visualize the workflow from activity to results and can help mitigate potential challenges. Logic models can be thought of as having an 'if this then that' structure where inputs -\> outputs -\> outcomes.

In the example below we have constructed a simple logic model for a hypothetical project where training materials are being developed for a group of educators to implement at their respective institutions.

Linkages are not always sequential and can be within categories, bi-directional and/or include feedback loops. Detailing this complexity of relationships, or theory of action, can be time-consuming but is a valuable part of the thought process for project planning. In exploring all relationships, logic modeling also allows for assessing program feasibility.

The above graphics include two sections within Outputs - Activities and Participants - and this is quite common. There is variation in logic model templates, including versions with a third type of output - "Products'. Sometimes description of these products is contained within the Activities section - for example, 'develop curricula', 'produce a report' - however calling these out explicitly is beneficial for teams focused on product development.

Program development (and logic modeling) occurs in response to a given 'Situation' or need, and exploring this is the first step in modeling. The situation defines the objective, or problem, that the program is designed to solve hence some logic models may omit the left-hand situation column but be framed with Problem and Solution statements. Finally, comprehensive logic modeling takes into consideration assumptions that are made with respect to the resources available, the people involved, or the way the program will work and also recognizes that there are external factors that can impact the program's success.

In summary:

Logic models support program development and evaluation and comprise three primary steps in the workflow:

-   **Inputs:** Resources, contributions, and investments required for a program;
-   **Outputs:** Activities conducted, participants reached, and products produced; and
-   **Outcomes:** Results or expected changes arising from the program structured as short-, medium- and long-term.

## Logic Models for Synthesis Research

Logic models are one tool for program development and have sufficient flexibility for a variety of situations, including planning for synthesis research. While some logic model categories may feel less relevant, the process of articulating a research objective, associated resources and activities and proposed outcome(s) has value. 

Below is a table of logic model elements and example questions for each element framed for both a typical logic model and synthesis research.

## Activity: Synthesis Planning with Logic Models

::: {.callout-tip title="Setup"}
Breakout into your research synthesis groups to refine your ideas for potential synthesis topics. Use either the **Logic Model Template** or a **Mermaid Flowchart** to create your logic model.

The goal for this activity is to develop one or more high-level logic models that:

1.  Summarize the synthesis research question
2.  Define the inputs needed to approach the synthesis research question
3.  Define the outputs including the activities, participants, and products needed to address the research question
4.  Define at least the short-term outcomes and long-term outcomes of the research

**Often it is helpful to start by working backwards.** Consider what outcomes are you trying to achieve, what outputs would help you get to those outcomes, and finally what inputs do you need to create those outputs.
