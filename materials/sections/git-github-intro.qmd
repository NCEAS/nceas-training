-   Create and configure `Git` repositories using different workflows

## Introduction to Version Control

![](images/phd_comics_final.png){width="70%" fig-align="center"}

Every file in the scientific process changes. Manuscripts are edited. Figures get revised. Code gets fixed when bugs are discovered. Sometimes those fixes lead to even more bugs, leading to more changes in the codebase. Data files get combined together. Sometimes those same files are split and combined again. All that to say - in just one research project, we can expect thousands of changes to occur. 

These changes are important to track, and yet, we often use simplistic filenames to track them. Many of us have experienced renaming a document or script multiple times with the ingenuine addition of "final" to the filename (like the comic above demonstrates).

You might think there is a better way, and you'd be right: **version control**. Version control provides an organized and transparent way to track changes in code and additional files. This practice was designed for software development, but is easily applicable to scientific programming.

There are many benefits to using a version control software including:

-   **Maintain** a history of your research project's development while keeping your workspace clean
-   **Facilitate collaboration** and transparency when working on teams
-   **Explore bugs or new features** without disrupting your team members' work
-   and more!

The version control system we'll be diving into is `Git`, the most widely used modern version control system in the world.

## Introduction to `Git` + GitHub

Before diving into the details of `Git` and how to use it, let's start with a motivating example that's representative of the types of problems `Git` can help us solve.

### A Motivating Example

Say, for example, you're working on an analysis in R and you've got it into a state you're pretty happy with. We'll call this version 1:

:::{.column-body-outset-right}
![](images/git-intro-slide01.png)
:::

You come into the office the following day and you have an email from your boss, "Hey, you know what this model needs?"

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/git-intro-slide02.png)
:::

You're not entirely sure what she means but you figure there's only one thing she could be talking about: more cowbell. So you add it to the model in order to really explore the space.

But you're worried about losing track of the old model so, instead of editing the code in place, you comment out the old code and put as serious a warning as you can muster in a comment above it.

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/git-intro-slide03.png)
:::

Commenting out code you don't want to lose is something probably all of us have done at one point or another but it's really hard to understand why you did this when you come back years later or you when you send your script to a colleague. Luckily, there's a better way: Version control. Instead of commenting out the old code, we can change the code in place and tell `Git` to commit our change. So now we have two distinct versions of our analysis and we can always see what the previous version(s) look like.

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/git-intro-slide04.png)
:::

You may have noticed something else in the diagram above: Not only can we save a new version of our analysis, we can also write as much text as we like about the change in the commit message. In addition to the commit message, `Git` also tracks who, when, and where the change was made.

Imagine that some time has gone by and you've committed a third version of your analysis, version 3, and a colleague emails with an idea: What if you used machine learning instead?

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/git-intro-slide05.png)
:::

Maybe you're not so sure the idea will work out and this is where a tool like `Git` shines. Without a tool like `Git`, we might copy analysis.R to another file called analysis-ml.R which might end up having mostly the same code except for a few lines. This isn't particularly problematic until you want to make a change to a bit of shared code and now you have to make changes in two files, if you even remember to.

Instead, with `Git`, we can start a branch. Branches allow us to confidently experiment on our code, all while leaving the old code in tact and recoverable.

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/git-intro-slide06.png)
:::

So you've been working in a branch and have made a few commits on it and your boss emails again asking you to update the model in some way. If you weren't using a tool like `Git`, you might panic at this point because you've rewritten much of your analysis to use a different method but your boss wants change to the old method.

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/git-intro-slide07.png)
:::

But with `Git` and branches, we can continue developing our main analysis at the same time as we are working on any experimental branches. Branches are great for experiments but also great for organizing your work generally.

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/git-intro-slide08.png)
:::

After all that hard work on the machine learning experiment, you and your colleague could decide to scrap it. It's perfectly fine to leave branches around and switch back to the main line of development but we can also delete them to tidy up.

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/git-intro-slide09.png)
:::

If, instead, you and your colleague had decided you liked the machine learning experiment, you could also merge the branch with your main development line. Merging branches is analogous to accepting a change in Word's Track Changes feature but way more powerful and useful.

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/git-intro-slide10.png)
:::

A key takeaway here is that `Git` can drastically increase your confidence and willingness to make changes to your code and help you avoid problems down the road. Analysis rarely follows a linear path and we need a tool that respects this.

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/git-intro-slide11.png)
:::

Finally, imagine that, years later, your colleague asks you to make sure the model you reported in a paper you published together was actually the one you used. Another really powerful feature of `Git` is tags which allow us to record a particular state of our analysis with a meaningful name. In this case, we are lucky because we tagged the version of our code we used to run the analysis. Even if we continued to develop beyond commit 5 (above) after we submitted our manuscript, we can always go back and run the analysis as it was in the past.

#### With `Git` we can enhance our workflow: {.unnumbered}

- **Eliminate** the need for **cryptic filenames** and comments to track our work.
- Provide **detailed descriptions of our changes** through commits, making it easier to understand the reasons behind code modifications.
- Work on multiple **branches** simultaneously, allowing for parallel development, and optionally merge them together.
- Use commits to **access and even execute older versions** of our code.
- **Assign meaningful tags** to specific versions of our code.
- Additionally, `Git` offers a powerful distributed feature. **Multiple individuals can work on the same analysis concurrently** on their own computers, with the ability to merge everyone's changes together.

### What *exactly* are `Git` and GitHub?

#### `Git`: {.unnumbered}

-   an open-source distributed **version control** software
- designed to manage the versioning and tracking of source code files and project history
-   **operates locally** on your computer, allowing you to create repositories, and track changes
- provides features such as committing changes, branching and merging code, reverting to previous versions, and managing project history
- works directly with the files on your computer and does not require a network connection to perform most operations
- primarily used through the command-line interface (CLI, e.g. Terminal), but also has various GUI tools available (e.g. RStudio IDE)

::: {.column-margin}
![](images/git-intro.png)
:::

#### GitHub: {.unnumbered}
- **online platform** and service built around `Git`
- provides a **centralized hosting platform for Git repositories**
- allows us to store, manage, and collaborate on their `Git` repositories in the cloud
-  offers additional features on top of `Git`, such as a web-based interface, issue tracking, project management tools, pull requests, code review, and collaboration features
-   enables easy sharing of code with others, facilitating collaboration and contribution to open source projects
-   provides a social aspect, allowing users to follow projects, star repositories, and discover new code

### Understanding how local working files, `Git`, and GitHub all work together

It can be a bit daunting to understand all the moving parts of the `Git` / GitHub life cycle (i.e. how file changes are tracked locally within repositories, then stored for safe-keeping and collaboration on remote repositories, then brought back down to a local machine(s) for continued development). It gets easier with practice, but we'll explain (first in words, then with an illustration) at a high-level how things work:

#### What is the difference between a "normal" folder vs. a `Git` repository

Whether you're a Mac or a PC user, you'll likely have created a folder at some point in time for organizing files. Let's pretend that we create a folder, called `myFolder/`, and add two files: `myData.csv` and `myAnalysis.R`. The contents of this folder are not currently version controlled -- meaning, for example, that if we make some changes to `myAnalysis.R` that don't quite work out, we have no way of accessing or reverting back to a previous version of `myAnalysis.R` (without remembering/rewriting things, of course).

`Git` allows you to turn any "normal" folder, like `myFolder/`, into a **Git repository** -- you'll often see/hear this referenced as "initializing a Git repository". When you initialize a folder on your local computer as a Git repository, a hidden `.git/` folder is created *within* that folder (e.g. `myFolder/.git/`) -- this `.git/` folder *is* the **Git repository**. As you use `Git` commands to capture versions or "snapshots" of your work, those versions (and their associated metadata) get stored within the `.git/` folder. This allows you to access and/or recover any previous versions of your work. If you delete `.git/`, you delete your project's history.

Here is our example folder / Git repository represented visually:

<br>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/git-repo.png")
```

<br>

#### How do I actually tell `Git` to preserve versions of my local working files?

Git was built as a command-line tool, meaning we can use `Git` commands in the command line (e.g. Terminal, Git Bash, etc.) to take "snapshots" of our local working files through time. Alternatively, RStudio provides buttons that help to easily execute these Git commands.

Generally, that workflow looks something like this:

- Make changes to a file(s) (e.g. `myAnalysis.R`) in your working directory.
- Stage the file(s) using `git add myAnalysis.R` (or `git add .` to stage multiple changed files at once). This lets Git know that you'd like to include the file(s) in your next commit.
- Commit the file(s) using `git commit -m "a message describing my changes"`. This records those changes (along with a descriptive message) as a "snapshot" or version in the local repository (i.e. the `.git/` folder).

#### My versioned work is on my local computer, but I want to send it to GitHub. How?

The last step is synchronizing the changes made to our local repository with a remote repository (oftentimes, this remote repository is stored on GitHub). The `git push` command is used to send local commits up to a remote repository. The `git pull` command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into the local repository -- **pull**ing will become a regular part of your workflow when collaborating with others, or even when working alone but on different machines (e.g. a laptop at home and a desktop at the office).

The processes described in the above sections (i.e. making changes to local working files, recording "snapshots" of them to create a versioned history of changes in a Git repository, and sending those versions from our local Git repository to a remote repository (which is oftentimes GitHub)) is illustrated using islands, buildings, bunnies, and packages in the artwork, below:

[A basic git workflow represented as two islands, one with "local repo" and "working directory", and another with "remote repo." Bunnies move file boxes from the working directory to the staging area, then with Commit move them to the local repo. Bunnies in rowboats move changes from the local repo to the remote repo (labeled "PUSH") and from the remote repo to the working directory (labeled "PULL").]{.aside}

### Let's Look at a GitHub Repository

This screen shows the copy of a repository stored on GitHub, with its list of files, when the files and directories were last modified, and some information on who made the most recent changes.

:::{.column-page}
![](images/ss3sim-github.png)
:::

If we drill into the "commits" for the repository, we can see the history of changes made to all of the files. Looks like `kellijohnson` was working on the project and fixing errors in December:

:::{.column-page}
![](images/ss3sim-commits.png)
:::

And finally, if we drill into one of the changes made on December 20, we can see exactly what was changed in each file:

:::{.column-page}
![](images/ss3sim-diff.png)
:::

Tracking these changes, how they relate to released versions of software and files is exactly what `Git` and GitHub are good for. And we will show how they can really be effective for tracking versions of scientific code, figures, and manuscripts to accomplish a reproducible workflow.

### `Git` Vocabulary & Commands

: Advanced `Git` Commands

`Git` has a rich set of commands and features, and there are many more terms beyond either table. Learn more by visiting the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).

## Exercise 1: Create a remote repository on GitHub

::: callout-tip
## Setup

1.  Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2.  Click the **New repository** button
3.  Name it `{FIRSTNAME}_test`
4.  Add a short description
5.  Check the box to add a `README.md` file
6.  Add a `.gitignore` file using the `R` template
7.  Set the `LICENSE` to Apache 2.0
:::

If you were successful, it should look something like this:

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/new-repo-github.png)
:::

You've now created your first repository! It has a couple of files that GitHub created for you, like the `README.md` file, and the `LICENSE` file, and the `.gitignore` file.

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/github-test-repo.png)
:::

For simple changes to text files, you can make edits right in the GitHub web interface.

::: callout-note
## Challenge

Navigate to the `README.md` file in the file listing, and edit it by clicking on the pencil icon. This is a regular Markdown file, so you can just add markdown text. Add a new level 2 header called "Purpose" and add some bullet points describing the purpose of the repo. When done, add a commit message, and hit the **Commit changes** button.
:::

:::{.column-page}
![](images/github-test-edit.png)
:::

Congratulations, you've now authored your first versioned commit! If you navigate back to the GitHub page for the repository, you'll see your commit listed there, as well as the rendered `README.md` file.

:::{.column-page}
![](images/github-test-displayed.png)
:::

Let's point out a few things about this window. It represents a view of the repository that you created, showing all of the files in the repository so far. For each file, it shows when the file was last modified, and the commit message that was used to last change each file. This is why it is important to write good, descriptive commit messages. In addition, the header above the file listing shows the most recent commit, along with its commit message, and its SHA identifier. That SHA identifier is the key to this set of versioned changes. If you click on the SHA identifier (6c18e0a), it will display the set of changes made in that particular commit.

::: {.callout-caution icon=false}
## What should I write in my commit message?

Writing effective `Git` commit messages is essential for creating a meaningful and helpful version history in your repository. It is crucial to avoid skipping commit messages or resorting to generic phrases like "Updates." When it comes to following best practices, there are several guidelines to enhance the readability and maintainability of the codebase.

Here are some guidelines for writing effective `Git` commit messages:

1. **Be descriptive and concise**: Provide a clear and concise summary of the changes made in the commit. Aim to convey the purpose and impact of the commit in a few words.

2. **Use imperative tense**: Write commit messages in the imperative tense, as if giving a command. For example, use "Add feature" instead of "Added feature" or "Adding feature." This convention aligns with other `Git` commands and makes the messages more actionable.

3. **Separate subject and body**: Start with a subject line, followed by a blank line, and then provide a more detailed explanation in the body if necessary. The subject line should be a short, one-line summary, while the body can provide additional context, motivation, or details about the changes.

4. **Limit the subject line length**: Keep the subject line within 50 characters or less. This ensures that the commit messages are easily scannable and fit well in tools like `Git` logs.

5. **Capitalize and punctuate properly**: Begin the subject line with a capital letter and use proper punctuation. This adds clarity and consistency to the commit messages.

6. **Focus on the "what" and "why"**: Explain what changes were made and why they were made. Understanding the motivation behind a commit helps future researchers and collaborators (including you!) comprehend its purpose.

7. **Use present tense for subject, past tense for body**: Write the subject line in present tense as it represents the current state of the codebase. Use past tense in the body to describe what has been done.

8. **Reference relevant issues**: If the commit is related to a specific issue or task, include a reference to it. For example, you can mention the issue number or use keywords like "Fixes," "Closes," or "Resolves" followed by the issue number.

## Exercise 2: `clone` your repository and use `Git` locally in RStudio

In this exercise, we'll use the GitHub `URL` for the GitHub repository you created to `clone` the repository onto your local machine so that you can edit the files in RStudio. 

Start by copying the GitHub `URL`, which represents the repository location:

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/github-test-clone-url.png){width="70%" fig-align="center"}
:::

RStudio knows how to work with files under version control with `Git`, but only if you are working within an R project folder. 

Next, let's `clone` the repository created on GitHub so we have it accessible as an R project in RStudio.

::: {.callout-important title="An important distinction"}
We refer to the **remote copy** of the repository that is on GitHub as the **origin repository** (the one that we cloned from), and the copy on our local computer as the local repository.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Setup

-   In the File menu, select "New Project"
-   In the dialog that pops up, select the "Version Control" option, and paste the GitHub URL that you copied into the field for the remote repository Repository URL
-   While you can name the local copy of the repository anything, it's typical to use the same name as the GitHub repository to maintain the correspondence

![](images/rstudio-clone-repo.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}
:::

Once you hit "Create Project", a new RStudio window will open with all of the files from the remote repository copied locally. Depending on how your version of RStudio is configured, the location and size of the panes may differ, but they should all be present, including a **Git** tab and the normal **Files** tab listing the files that had been created in the remote repository.

:::{.column-body-outset}
![](images/github-rstudio-test.png)
:::

You'll note that there is one new file `halina_test.Rproj`, and three files that we created earlier on GitHub (`.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md`).

In the **Git** tab, you'll note that one file is listed. The **Git** tab is the status pane that shows the current modification status of all of the files in the repository. Here, we see `halina_test.Rproj` is preceded by a **??** symbol to indicate that the file is currently untracked. This means that `Git` has not stored any versions of this file, and knows nothing about the file (hang tight, we'll commit this file soon so that it's tracked by `Git`). As you make version control decisions in RStudio, these icons will change to reflect the current version status of each of the files.

Inspect the history. For now, let's click on the **History** button in the **Git** tab, which will show the log of changes that occurred, and will be identical to what we viewed on GitHub. By clicking on each row of the history, you can see exactly what was added and changed in each of the two commits in this repository.

![](images/rstudio-history-1.png)

::: callout-note
## Challenge

1.  Let's make a change to the `README.md` file, this time from RStudio, then commit the `README.md` change
2.  Add a new section to your `README.md` called "Creator" using a level 2 header, and under it include some information about yourself. **Bonus:** Add some contact information and link your email using Markdown syntax
:::

Once you save, you'll immediately see the `README.md` file show up in the **Git** tab, marked as a modification. You can select the file in the **Git** tab, and click **Diff** to see the differences that you saved (but which are not yet committed to your local repository).

![](images/rstudio-status-pane.png)

And here's what the newly made changes look like compared to the original file. New lines are highlighted in green, while removed lines are in red.

![](images/rstudio-diff.png)

**Commit the RStudio changes.** To commit the changes you made to the `README.md` file, check the Staged checkbox next to the file (which tells `Git` which changes you want included in the commit), then provide a descriptive commit message, and then click "Commit".

![](images/rstudio-commit-1.png)

Note that some of the changes in the repository, namely `halina_test.Rproj` are still listed as having not been committed. This means there are still pending changes to the repository. You can also see the note that says:

`Your branch is ahead of ‘origin/main’ by 1 commit.`

This means that we have committed 1 change in the local repository, but that commit has not yet been pushed up to the `origin` repository, where `origin` is the typical name for our remote repository on GitHub. So, let's commit the remaining project files by staging them and adding a commit message.

![](images/rstudio-commit-2.png)

When finished, you'll see that no changes remain in the **Git** tab, and the repository is clean.

**Inspect the history.** Note that the message now says:

`Your branch is ahead of ‘origin/main’ by 2 commits.`

These 2 commits are the two we just made, and have not yet been pushed to GitHub. By clicking on the **History** button, we can see that there are now a total of four commits in the local repository (while there had only been two on GitHub).

![](images/rstudio-history-2.png)

**Push these changes to GitHub.** Now that we've made and committed changes locally, we can push those changes to GitHub using the **Push** button. This sends your changes to the remote repository (on GitHub) leaving your repository in a totally clean and synchronized state (meaning your local repository and remote repository should look the same). When finished, you should see all four commits in the **History** window -- this includes the two that were committed on GitHub (via the web browser) and the two that were committed locally from RStudio.

::: {.callout-note}
## If you are prompted to provide your GitHub username and password when **Push**ing...
it's a good indicator that you did not set your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) correctly. You can redo the steps outlined in the [Appendix](session_12#github-authentication) to (re)set your PAT, then **Push** again.

And note that the labels indicate that both the local repository (`HEAD`) and the remote repository (`origin/HEAD`) are pointing at the same version in the history. So, if we go look at the commit history on GitHub, all the commits will be shown there as well.

## Last thing, some `Git` configuration

When `Git` released version 2.27, a new feature they incorporated allows users to specify how to pull (essentially), otherwise a warning will appear. To suppress this warning we need to configure our `Git` with this line of code:

``` bash
git config pull.rebase false
```

`pull.rebase false` is a default strategy for pulling where it will try to auto-merge the files if possible, and if it can't it will show a merge conflict

## Exercise 3: Setting up `Git` on an existing project

Now you have two projects set up in your RStudio environment, `training_{USERNAME}` and `{FIRSTNAME}_test`. We set you up with the `{FIRSTNAME}_test` project since we think it is an easy way to introduce you to `Git`, but more commonly researchers will have an existing directory of code that they then want to make a `Git` repository out of. For the last exercise of this session, we will do this with your `training_{USERNAME}` project.

First, switch to your `training_{USERNAME}` project using the RStudio project dropdown menu. The project dropdown menu is in the upper right corner of your RStudio pane. Click the dropdown next to your project name (`{FIRSTNAME}_test`), and then select the `training_{USERNAME}` project from the "recent projects" list.

Next, from the Tools menu, select "Project Options." In the dialog that pops up, select "Git/SVN" from the menu on the left. In the dropdown at the top of this page, select `Git` and click "Yes" in the confirmation box. Click "Yes" again to restart RStudio.

When RStudio restarts, you should have a **Git** tab, with two untracked files (`.gitignore` and `training_{USERNAME}.Rproj`).

::: callout-note
## Challenge

Add and commit the `.gitignore` and `training_{USERNAME}.Rproj` files to your `Git` repository.
:::

Now we have your local repository all set up. You can make as many commits as you want on this repository, and it will likely still be helpful to you, but the power in `Git` and GitHub is really in collaboration. As discussed, GitHub facilitates this, so let's get this repository on GitHub.

::: callout-tip
## Setup

1.  Go to [GitHub](http://github.com/), and click on the **New Repository** button.
2.  In the repository name field, enter the **same name as your R Project**. So for me, this would be `training_dolinh.`
3.  Add a description, keep the repository public, and, most importantly: **DO NOT INITIALIZE THE REPOSITORY WITH ANY FILES**. We already have the repository set up locally so we don't need to do this. Initializing the repository will only cause merge issues.

Here is what your page should look like:

![](images/create-empty-repo.png){width="77%" fig-align="center"}

4.  Click the **Create repository** button.
:::

This will open your empty repository with a page that conveniently gives you exactly the instructions you need. In our case, we are going to "push an existing repository from the command line."

:::{.column-page}
![](images/setup-empty-repo.png)
:::

Click the clipboard icon to copy the code for the middle option of the three on this page. It should have three lines and look like this:

``` bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/hdolinh/training_dolinh.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Back in RStudio, open the terminal by clicking the **Terminal** tab next to the **Console** tab. The prompt should look something like this:

``` bash
dolinh@included-crab:~/training_dolinh$
```

In the prompt, paste the code that you copied from the GitHub page and press `return`.

The code that you copied and pasted did three things:

-   Added the GitHub repository as the remote repository
-   Renamed the default branch to main
-   Pushed the main branch to the remote GitHub repository

If you go back to your browser and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your files appear.

::: callout-note
## Challenge

On your repository page, GitHub has a button that will help you add a `README.md` file. Click the **Add a README** button and use markdown syntax to create a `README.md` Commit the changes to your repository.

Go to your local repository (in RStudio) and pull the changes you made.

## Go further with `Git`

There's a lot we haven't covered in this brief tutorial. There are some great and much longer tutorials that cover advanced topics, such as:

-   Using `Git` on the command line
-   Resolving conflicts
-   Branching and merging
-   Pull requests versus direct contributions for collaboration
-   Using `.gitignore` to protect sensitive data
-   GitHub Issues - how to use them for project management and collaboration

and much, much more.
