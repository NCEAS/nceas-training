## Data Publishing and Documentation, Part Two

### Open Data and Ethics

As the primary data repository for the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs Arctic Sciences section, the Arctic Data Center accepts data from all disciplines including social science and other research that may be subject to IRB restrictions, involve Indigenous knowledge, or have been carried out on Indigenous lands. Researchers submitting data now have the opportunity to articulate these and other considerations as part of the metadata record. First, researchers can identify the level of sensitivity that best represents the dataset from one of three sensitivity data tags ranging from non-confidential information to maximally sensitive information that best fit their data and/or metadata. Based on the level of sensitivity, guidelines and next steps for data submission are provided.
