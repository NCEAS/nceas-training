## Writing Good Data Management Plans

### Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:

- Why create data management plans
- The major components of data management plans
- Tools that can help create a data management plan
- Features and functionality of the DMPTool

### When to Plan: The Data Life Cycle

Shown below is one version of the [Data Life Cycle](https://www.dataone.org/data-life-cycle) that was developed by DataONE. The data life cycle provides a high level overview of the stages involved in successful management and preservation of data for use and reuse. Multiple versions of a data life cycle exist with differences attributable to variation in practices across domains or communities. It is not neccesary for researchers to move through the data life cycle in a cylical fashion and some research activities might use only part of the life cycle. For instance, a project involving meta-analysis might focus on the Discover, Integrate, and Analyze steps, while a project focused on primary data collection and analysis might bypass the Discover and Integrate steps. However, 'Plan' is at the top of the data life cycle as it is advisable to initiate your data management planning at the beginning of your research process, before any data has been collected.

### Why Plan?

Planning data management in advance povides a number of benefits to the researcher.

- **Saves time and increases efficiency**; Data management planning requires that a researcher think about data handling in advance of data collection, potentially raising any challenges before they are encountered. 
- **Engages your team**; Being able to plan effectively will require conversation with multiple parties, engaging project participants from the outset.
- **Allows you to stay organized**; It will be easier to organize your data for analysis and reuse.
- **Meet funder requirements**; Funders require a data management plan as part of the proposal process.
- **Share data**; Information in the DMP is the foundation for archiving and sharing data with community.

### How to Plan

1) As indicated above, engaging your team is a benefit of data management planning. Collaborators involved in the data collection and processing of your research data bring diverse expertise. Therefore, **plan in collaboration** with these individuals. 
2) Make sure to **plan from the start** to avoid confusion, data loss, and increase efficiency. Given DMPs are a requirement of funding agencies, it is nearly always neccesary to plan from the start. However, the same should apply to research that is being undertaken outside of a specific funded proposal.
3) Make sure to **utilize resources** that are available to assist you in helping to write a good DMP. These might include your institutional library or organization data manager, online resources or education materials such as these.
4) **Use tools** available to you; you donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel.
5) **Revise your plan** as situations change and you potentially adapt/alter your project. Like your research projects, data management plans are not static, they require changes and updates throughout the research project process.

### What to include in a DMP

If you are writing a data management plan as part of a solicitation proposal, the funding agency will have guidelines for the information they want to be provided in the plan. A good plan will provide information on the study design; data to be collected; metadata; policies for access, sharing & reuse; long-term storage & data management; and budget. 

*A note on Metadata:*
Both basic metadata (such as title and researcher contact information) and comprehensive metadata (such as complete methods of data collection) are critical for accurate interpretation and understanding. The full definitions of variables, especially units, inside each dataset are also critical as they relate to the methods used for creation. Knowing certain blocking or grouping methods, for example, would be necessary to understand studies for proper comparisons and synthesis. 


### NSF DMP requirements

In the 2014 Proposal Preparation Instructions, Section J ['Special Information and Supplementary Documentation'](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf14001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j) NSF put foward the baseline requirements for a data management plan. In addition, there are specific divison and program requirements that provide additional detail. If you are working on a research project with funding that does not require a data management plan, or are developing a plan for unfunded research, the NSF generic requirements are a good set of guidelines to follow.

**Five Sections of the NSF DMP Requirements**

**1. Products of research**  
Types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, other materials produced during project

**2. Data formats and standards**  
Standards to be used for data and metadata format and content (for initial data collection, as well as subsequent storageand processing)

**3. Policies for access and sharing**  
Provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements

**4. Policies and provisions for re-use**  
Including re-distribution and the production of derivatives

**5. Archiving of data**  
Plans for archiving data, samples, research products and for preservation of access


### Tools in Support of Creating a DMP

![](images/dmptools.jpg)

The [DMP Tool](https://dmptool.org) and [DMP Online](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) are both easy to use web based tools that support the development of a DMP. The tools are partnered and share a code base; the DMPTool incorporates templates from US funding agencies and the DMP Online is focussed on EU requirements.

### Arctic Data Center Support for DMPs

To support researchers in creating Data Management Plans that fulfils NSF template requirements and provides guidance on how to work with the Arctic Data Center for preservation, we have created an Arctic Data Center template within the DMPTool. This template walks researchers through the questions required by NSF and includes recommendations directly from the Arctic Data Center team.

![](images/DMP_5.png)

When creating a new plan, indicate that your funding agency is the National Science Foundation and you will then have the option to select a template. Here you can choose the Arctic Data Center.

As you answer the questions posed, guidance information from the Arctic Data Center will be visible under the 'NSF' tab on the right hand side. An example answer is also provided at the bottom. It is not intended that you copy and paste this verbatim. Rather, this is example prose that you can refer to for answering the question.

### Sharing Your DMP

The DMPTool allows you to collaborate with authorized individuals on your plan and also to publish it (make it publicly accessible) via the website. If your research activity is funded, it is also useful to share your DMP with the Arctic Data Center. This is not an NSF requirement, but can greatly help the Arctic Data Center team prepare for your data submission. Especially if you are anticipating a high volume of data.

### Additional Resources

The article [Ten Simple Rules for Creating a Good Data Management Plan](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004525) is a great resource for thinking about writing a data management plan and the information you should include within the plan.
