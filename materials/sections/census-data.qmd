## Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}
- Provide an overview of US Census data
- Introduce the main functions of the `tidycensus` package to be able to work with census data
- Review data wrangling function to get census data ready for analysis


<!--## Overview
(Chapter 1 - 5 min)
- General view of US Census Data
- Decennial US Census
- American Community Survey (ACS)

"While the decennial US Census and American Community Survey are the most popular and widely used datasets produced by the US Census Bureau, the Bureau conducts hundreds of other surveys and disseminates data on a wide range of subjects to the public. These datasets include economic and business surveys, housing surveys, international data, population estimates and projections, and much more; a full listing is available on the Census website."

- How is Census data available
- The Census API

## Introduction to `tidycensus`
(Chapter 2 - 5 min)
"The `tidycensus` is an R package that provides an interface to access and work with the United States Census Bureau data. It simplifies the process of retrieving and analyzing census data by allowing users to query data directly from the Census Bureau's API and then organize the data into a tidy format for easy manipulation and analysis."



## Getting Started
In order to be able to use the `tidycensus` package, we need to:

-   Install the package in our machine (run: `install.package("tidycensus")` in the console)
-   Get an API key to connect our session with the census data and be able to retrieve data 

As we are working in the server, the package is already installed in our system (so we can skip this step). But when you go work in your own computers, you will have to install the package if you haven't done that already.
