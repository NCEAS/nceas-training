## Research Data Publishing Ethics

For over 20 years, the [Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)](https://publicationethics.org/) has provided trusted guidance on ethical practices for scholarly publishing.
The COPE guidelines have been broadly adopted by academic publishers across disciplines, and represent a common approach to identify, classify, and adjudicate potential breaches of ethics in publication such as authorship conflicts, peer review manipulation, and falsified findings, among many other areas.
Despite these guidelines, there has been a lack of ethics standards, guidelines, or recommendations for data publications, even while some groups have begun to evaluate and act upon reported issues in data publication ethics.

To address this gap, the [Force 11 Working Group on Research Data Publishing Ethics](https://force11.org/groups/research-data-publishing-ethics/home/) was formed as a collaboration among research data professionals and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) "to develop industry-leading guidance and recommended best practices to support repositories, journal publishers, and institutions in handling the ethical responsibilities associated with publishing research data." The group released the "Joint FORCE11 & COPE Research Data Publishing Ethics Working Group Recommendations" [@puebla_2021], which outlines recommendations for four categories of potential data ethics issues:

-   [Authorship and Contribution Conflicts](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293/files/Authorship%20%26%20Contributions_datapubethics.pdf?download=1)
    -   Authorship omissions
    -   Authorship ordering changes / conflicts
    -   Institutional investigation of author finds misconduct
-   [Legal/regulatory restrictions](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293/files/Legal%20%26%20Regulatory%20Restrictions_datapubethics.pdf?download=1)
    -   Copyright violation
    -   Insufficient rights for deposit
    -   Breaches of national privacy laws (GPDR, CCPA)
    -   Breaches of biosafety and biosecurity protocols
    -   Breaches of contract law governing data redistribution
-   [Risks of publication or release](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293/files/Risk_datapubethics.pdf?download=1)
    -   Risks to human subjects
        -   Lack of consent
        -   Breaches of himan rights
        -   Release of personally identifiable information (PII)
    -   Risks to species, ecosystems, historical sites
        -   Locations of endangered species or historical sites
    -   Risks to communities or societies
        -   Data harvested for profit or surveillance
        -   Breaches of data sovereignty
-   [Rigor of published data](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293/files/Rigor_datapubethics.pdf?download=1)
    -   Unintentional errors in collection, calculation, display
    -   Un-interpretable data due to lack of adequate documentation
    -   Errors of of study design and inference
    -   Data manipulation or fabrication

Guidelines cover what actions need to be taken, depending on whether the data are already published or not, as well as who should be involved in decisions, who should be notified of actions, and when the public should be notified.
The group has also published templates for use by publishers and repositories to announce the extent to which they plan to conform to the data ethics guidelines.

## Evaluating a Data Package

## Exercise: Evaluate a Data Package on the EDI Repository

Explore data packages published on EDI assess the quality of their metadata. Imagine you're a data curator!

::: callout-tip
### Setup

1. Break into groups and use the following data packages:
    a. **Group A:** EDI Data Portal [SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-sbc.77.8)
    b. **Group B:** EDI Data Portal [Physiological stress of American pika (Ochotona princeps) and associated habitat characteristics for Niwot Ridge, 2018 - 2019](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-nwt.268.1)
    c. **Group C:** EDI Data Portal [Ecological and social interactions in urban parks: bird surveys in local parks in the central Arizona-Phoenix metropolitan area](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-cap&identifier=256&revision=10)
:::


You and your group will evaluate a data package for its: (1) metadata quality, (2) data documentation quality for reproducibility, and (3) FAIRness and CAREness.

::: callout-note
### Exercise: Evaluate a data package on EDI Data Portal
1.  View our [Data Package Assessment Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PQpw9ohOMY7K1yBWaknMHV0dGEm0GnZ9pCB8_i2JPoU/edit?usp=sharing) and make a copy of it to:
    a. **Investigate the metadata in the provided data**
        i. Does the metadata meet the standards we talked about? How so?
        ii. If not, how would you improve the metadata based on the standards we talked about?
    b. **Investigate the overall data documentation in the data package**
        i. Is the documentation sufficient enough for reproducibility? Why or why not?
        ii. If not, how would you improve the data documentation? What's missing?
    c. **Identify elements of FAIR and CARE**
        i. Is it clear that the data package used a FAIR and CARE lens? 
        ii. If not, what documentation or considerations would you add?
2. Elect someone to share back to the group the following:
    a.  How easy or challenging was it to find the metadata and other data documentation you were evaluating? Why or why not?
    b. What documentation stood out to you? What did you like or not like about it?
    c. How well did these data packages uphold FAIR and CARE Principles?
    d. Do you feel like you understand the research project enough to use the data yourself (aka reproducibility?)
    
*If your group finishes early, check out more datasets in the bonus question.*

## Bonus: Investigate metadata and data documentation in other Data Repositories

Not all environmental data repositories document and publish datasets and data packages in the same way. Nor do they have the same submission requirements. It's helpful to become familiar with metadata and data documentation jargon so it's easier to identify the information you're looking for. It's also helpful for when you're nearing the end of your project and are getting ready to publish your datasets.

Evaluate the following data packages at these data repositories: 

1. KNB [Arthropod pitfall trap biomass captured (weekly) and pitfall biomass model predictions (daily) near Toolik Field Station, Alaska, summers 2012-2016](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/https%3A%2F%2Fpasta.lternet.edu%2Fpackage%2Fmetadata%2Feml%2Fknb-lter-arc%2F20052%2F1)
2. DataOne [USDA-NOAA NWS Daily Climatological Data](https://search.dataone.org/view/knb-lter-jrn.20020210.9893)
3. Arctic Data Center [Landscape evolution and adapting to change in ice-rich permafrost systems 2021-2022](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA2JQ0SW7X)

How different are these data repositories from the EDI Data Portal? Would you consider publishing you data at one or multiple of these repositories?
