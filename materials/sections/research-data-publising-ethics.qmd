## Research Data Publishing Ethics

For over 20 years, the [Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)](https://publicationethics.org/) has provided trusted guidance on ethical practices for scholarly publishing.
The COPE guidelines have been broadly adopted by academic publishers across disciplines, and represent a common approach to identify, classify, and adjudicate potential breaches of ethics in publication such as authorship conflicts, peer review manipulation, and falsified findings, among many other areas.
Despite these guidelines, there has been a lack of ethics standards, guidelines, or recommendations for data publications, even while some groups have begun to evaluate and act upon reported issues in data publication ethics.

To address this gap, the [Force 11 Working Group on Research Data Publishing Ethics](https://force11.org/groups/research-data-publishing-ethics/home/) was formed as a collaboration among research data professionals and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) "to develop industry-leading guidance and recommended best practices to support repositories, journal publishers, and institutions in handling the ethical responsibilities associated with publishing research data." The group released the "Joint FORCE11 & COPE Research Data Publishing Ethics Working Group Recommendations" [@puebla_2021], which outlines recommendations for four categories of potential data ethics issues:

-   [Authorship and Contribution Conflicts](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293/files/Authorship%20%26%20Contributions_datapubethics.pdf?download=1)
    -   Authorship omissions
    -   Authorship ordering changes / conflicts
    -   Institutional investigation of author finds misconduct
-   [Legal/regulatory restrictions](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293/files/Legal%20%26%20Regulatory%20Restrictions_datapubethics.pdf?download=1)
    -   Copyright violation
    -   Insufficient rights for deposit
    -   Breaches of national privacy laws (GPDR, CCPA)
    -   Breaches of biosafety and biosecurity protocols
    -   Breaches of contract law governing data redistribution
-   [Risks of publication or release](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293/files/Risk_datapubethics.pdf?download=1)
    -   Risks to human subjects
        -   Lack of consent
        -   Breaches of himan rights
        -   Release of personally identifiable information (PII)
    -   Risks to species, ecosystems, historical sites
        -   Locations of endangered species or historical sites
    -   Risks to communities or societies
        -   Data harvested for profit or surveillance
        -   Breaches of data sovereignty
-   [Rigor of published data](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293/files/Rigor_datapubethics.pdf?download=1)
    -   Unintentional errors in collection, calculation, display
    -   Un-interpretable data due to lack of adequate documentation
    -   Errors of of study design and inference
    -   Data manipulation or fabrication

Guidelines cover what actions need to be taken, depending on whether the data are already published or not, as well as who should be involved in decisions, who should be notified of actions, and when the public should be notified.
The group has also published templates for use by publishers and repositories to announce the extent to which they plan to conform to the data ethics guidelines.

## Data publishing policies

Consider the following hypothetical scenario:

> The data coordinator at the Arctic Data Center receives an email in 2022 from a prior postdoctoral fellow who was employed as part of an NSF-funded project on microbial diversity in Alaskan tundra ecosystems.
> The email states that a dataset from 2014 in the Arctic Data Center was published with the project PI as author, but omits two people, the postdoc and an undergraduate student, as co-authors on the dataset.
> The PI retired in 2019, and the postdoc asks that they be added to the author list of the dataset to correct the historical record and provide credit.

At the Arctic Data Center, we need to develop policies and procedures governing how we react to potential breaches of data publication ethics.
This exercise, aims to **instigate a group discussion on how the Arctic Data Center should respond to reports of data ethics issues**, and whether we should adopt the Joint FORCE11 & COPE Research Data Publishing Ethics Working Group Policy [Templates](https://zenodo.org/record/6422102/files/Repository%20Policy%20Template%20v1.pdf?download=1) for repositories.

-   **Guiding questions:**
    -   Should the repository adopt the repository [policy templates](https://zenodo.org/record/6422102/files/Repository%20Policy%20Template%20v1.pdf?download=1) from Force11?
    -   Who should be involved in evaluation of the merits of ethical cases reported to ADC?
    -    Who should be involved in deciding the actions to take?
    -   What are the range of responses that the repository should consider for ethical breaches?
    -   Who should be notified when a determination has been made that a breach has occurred?


Consider the  hypothetical scenario described above to for your response.
