## The Data Life Cycle - A Recap

The Data Life Cycle gives you an overview of meaningful steps data goes
through in a research project, from planning to archival. This
step-by-step breakdown facilitates overseeing individual actions,
operations and processes required at each stage.

| Step      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Plan      | Map out the processes and resources for the entire data life cycle. Start with the project goals (desired outputs, outcomes, and impacts) and work backwards to build a data management plan, supporting data policies, and sustainability plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Collect   | Observations are made either by hand or with sensors or other instruments and the data are placed a into digital form. You can structure the process of collecting data up front to better implement data management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Assure    | Employ quality assurance and quality control procedures that enhance the quality of data (e.g., training participants, routine instrument calibration) and identify potential errors and techniques to address them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Describe  | Document data by describing the why, who, what, when, where, and how of the data. Metadata, or data about data, are key to data sharing and reuse, and many tools such as standards and software are available to help describe data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Preserve  | Plan to preserve data in the short term to minimize potential losses (e.g., via accidents), and in the long term so that project stakeholders and others can access, interpret, and use the data in the future. Decide what data to preserve, where to preserve it, and what documentation needs to accompany the data.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Discover  | Identify complementary data sets that can add value to project data. Strategies to help endure the data have maximum impact include registering the project on a project directory site, depositing data in an open repository, and adding data descriptions to metadata clearing houses.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Integrate | Data from multiple sources are combined into a form that can be readily analyzed. For example, you could combine citizen science project data with other sources of data to enable new analyses and investigations. Successful data integration depends on documentation of the integration process, clearly citing and making accessable the data you are using, and employing good data management practices throughout the [Data Life Cycle](https://www.dataone.org/data-life-cycle). |
| Analyze   | Create analyses and visualizations to identify patterns, test hypotheses, and illustrate finding. During this process record your methods, document data processing steps, and ensure your data are reproduceable. Learn about these best practices and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In this lesson we focus on the *Describe* and *Preserve* stages of this
cycle. However, best practices on how to organize and document your
data, apply to all stages.

## Organizing Data

The goal is to operate through the data life cycle with the [FAIR and
CARE
principles](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-06-delta/session_16.html)
in mind and making sure our data is in a [tidy
format](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-06-delta/session_09.html#what-is-tidy-data).

![Artwork by Allison Horst](images/allison-horst-why-tidy-data.png)

Benefits of having clean and tidy data and complete metadata:

-   Decreases errors from redundant updates
-   Enforces data integrity
-   Helps you and future researchers to handle large, complex datasets
-   Enables powerful search filtering

Some of the best practices to follow are (@borer_simple_2009,
@white_nine_2013):

-   Have scripts for all data wrangling that start with the uncorrected
    raw data file and clean the data programmatically before analysis.
-   Design your tables to add rows, not columns. A column should be only
    one variable and a row should be only one observation.
-   Include header lines in your tables
-   Use non-proprietary file formats (ie, open source) with descriptive
    file names without spaces.

Non-proprietary file formats are essential to ensure that your data can
still be machine readable long into the future. Open formats include
text files and binary formats such as NetCDF.

![](images/open-formats.png)

Common switches:

| Proprietary format            | Export to...                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) files | text (.txt) or comma separated values (.csv) |
| GIS files                     | ESRI shapefiles (.shp)                       |
| MATLAB/IDL                    | NetCDF                                       |


:::callout-caution
## Large Data Packages

When you have or are going to generate large data packages (in the terabytes or larger), it's important to establish a relationship with the data center early on. 

The data center can help come up with a strategy to tile data structures by subset, such as by spatial region, by temporal window, or by measured variable. They can also help with choosing an efficient tool to store the data (ie NetCDF or HDF), which is a compact data format that helps parallel read and write libraries of data.

## Data sharing and preservation

![](images/WhyManage.png)

### Data repositories: built for data (and code)

-   GitHub is not an archival location
-   Dedicated data repositories: KNB, Arctic Data Center, Zenodo,
    FigShare
    -   Rich metadata
    -   Archival in their mission
-   Data papers, e.g., Scientific Data
-   List of data repositories: http://re3data.org

![](images/RepoLogos.png)

### Metadata

Metadata are documentation describing the content, context, and
structure of data to enable future interpretation and reuse of the data.
Generally, metadata describe who collected the data, what data were
collected, when and where it was collected, and why it was collected.

For consistency, metadata are typically structured following metadata
content standards such as the [Ecological Metadata Language
(EML)](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml/). For example,
here's an excerpt of the metadata for a sockeye salmon data set:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<eml:eml packageId="df35d.442.6" system="knb" 
    xmlns:eml="eml://ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.1.1">
    <dataset>
        <title>Improving Preseason Forecasts of Sockeye Salmon Runs through 
            Salmon Smolt Monitoring in Kenai River, Alaska: 2005 - 2007</title>
        <creator id="1385594069457">
            <individualName>
                <givenName>Mark</givenName>
                <surName>Willette</surName>
            </individualName>
            <organizationName>Alaska Department of Fish and Game</organizationName>
            <positionName>Fishery Biologist</positionName>
            <address>
                <city>Soldotna</city>
                <administrativeArea>Alaska</administrativeArea>
                <country>USA</country>
            </address>
            <phone phonetype="voice">(907)260-2911</phone>
            <electronicMailAddress>mark.willette@alaska.gov</electronicMailAddress>
        </creator>
        ...
    </dataset>
</eml:eml>
```

That same metadata document can be converted to HTML format and
displayed in a much more readable form on the web:
https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F1F18WN4

![](images/knb-metadata.png) And as you can see, the whole data set or
its components can be downloaded and reused.

Also note that the repository tracks how many times each file has been
downloaded, which gives great feedback to researchers on the activity
for their published data.

### Structure of a data package

Note that the data set above lists a collection of files that are
contained within the data set. We define a *data package* as a
scientifically useful collection of data and metadata that a researcher
wants to preserve. Sometimes a data package represents all of the data
from a particular experiment, while at other times it might be all of
the data from a grant, or on a topic, or associated with a paper.
Whatever the extent, we define a data package as having one or more data
files, software files, and other scientific products such as graphs and
images, all tied together with a descriptive metadata document.

![](images/data-package.png) These data repositories all assign a unique
identifier to every version of every data file, similarly to how it
works with source code commits in GitHub. Those identifiers usually take
one of two forms. A *DOI* identifier is often assigned to the metadata
and becomes the publicly citable identifier for the package. Each of the
other files gets an internal identifier, often a UUID that is globally
unique. In the example above, the package can be cited with the DOI
`doi:10.5063/F1F18WN4`.

### DataONE Federation

DataONE is a federation of dozens of data repositories that work
together to make their systems interoperable and to provide a single
unified search system that spans the repositories. DataONE aims to make
it simpler for researchers to publish data to one of its member
repositories, and then to discover and download that data for reuse in
synthetic analyses.

DataONE can be searched on the web (https://search.dataone.org/), which
effectively allows a single search to find data form the dozens of
members of DataONE, rather than visiting each of the currently 43
repositories one at a time.

![](images/DataONECNs.png)

## Publishing data from the web

Each data repository tends to have its own mechanism for submitting data
and providing metadata. With repositories like the KNB Data Repository
and the Arctic Data Center, we provide some easy to use web forms for
editing and submitting a data package. Let's walk through a web
submission to see what you might expect.

::: callout-tip
## Setup

**Download the data to be used for the tutorial**

I've already uploaded the test data package, and so you can access the
data here:

-   https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu/view/urn:uuid:0702cc63-4483-4af4-a218-531ccc59069f

Grab both CSV files, and the R script, and store them in a convenient
folder.

![](images/hatfield-knb-01.png)

## Login via ORCID

We will walk through web submission on https://demo.nceas.ucsb.edu, and
start by logging in with an ORCID account. ORCID provides a common
account for sharing scholarly data, so if you don't have one, you can
create one when you are redirected to ORCID from the *Sign In* button.

![](images/knb-banner.png)

When you sign in, you will be redirected to
[orcid.org](https://orcid.org), where you can either provide your
existing ORCID credentials, or create a new account. ORCID provides
multiple ways to login, including using your email address,
institutional logins from many universities, and logins from social
media account providers. Choose the one that is best suited to your use
as a scholarly record, such as your university or agency login.

![](images/orcid-login.png)

#### Create and submit the data set {.unnumbered}

After signing in, you can access the data submission form using the
*Submit* button. Once on the form, upload your data files and follow the
prompts to provide the required metadata. Required sections are listed
with a red asterisk.

##### Click **Add Files** to choose the data files for your package {.unnumbered}

You can select multiple files at a time to efficiently upload many
files.

![](images/editor-knb-01.png)

The files will upload showing a progress indicator. You can continue
editing metadata while they upload.

![](images/editor-knb-02.png)

##### Enter Overview information {.unnumbered}

This includes a descriptive title, abstract, and keywords.

The title is the first way a potential user will get information about
your dataset. It should be descriptive but succinct, lack acronyms, and
include some indication of the temporal and geospatial coverage of the
data.

The abstract should be sufficently descriptive for a general scientific
audience to understand your dataset at a high level. It should provide
an overview of the scientific context/project/hypotheses, how this data
package fits into the larger context, a synopsis of the experimental or
sampling design, and a summary of the data contents.

![](images/editor-knb-03.png)

Keywords, while not required, can help increase the searchability of
your dataset, particularly if they come from a semantically defined
keyword thesaurus.

![](images/editor-knb-04.png)

Optionally, you can also enter funding information, including a funding
number, which can help link multiple datasets collected under the same
grant.

Selecting a distribution license - either
[CC-0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) or
[CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) is required.

![](images/editor-knb-05.png)

##### People Information {.unnumbered}

Information about the people associated with the dataset is essential to
provide credit through citation and to help people understand who made
contributions to the product. Enter information for the following
people:

-   Creators - **all the people who should be in the citation for the
    dataset**
-   Contacts - one is required, but defaults to the first Creator if
    omitted
-   Principal Investigators
-   and any other that are relevant

For each, please strive to provide their [ORCID](https://orcid.org)
identifier, which helps link this dataset to their other scholarly
works.

![](images/editor-knb-06.png)

##### Temporal Information

Add the temporal coverage of the data, which represents the time period
to which data apply.

![](images/editor-knb-09.png)

##### Location Information {.unnumbered}

The geospatial location that the data were collected is critical for
discovery and interpretation of the data. Coordinates are entered in
decimal degrees, and be sure to use negative values for West longitudes.
The editor allows you to enter multiple locations, which you should do
if you had noncontiguous sampling locations. This is particularly
important if your sites are separated by large distances, so that a
spatial search will be more precise.

![](images/editor-knb-07.png)

Note that, if you miss fields that are required, they will be
highlighted in red to draw your attention. In this case, for the
description, provide a comma-separated place name, ordered from the
local to global. For example:

-   Mission Canyon, Santa Barbara, California, USA

![](images/editor-knb-08.png)

##### Methods {.unnumbered}

Methods are critical to accurate interpretation and reuse of your data.
The editor allows you to add multiple different methods sections,
include details of sampling methods, experimental design, quality
assurance procedures, and computational techniques and software. Please
be complete with your methods sections, as they are fundamentally
important to reuse of the data.

![](images/editor-knb-10.png)

##### Save a first version with **Submit** {.unnumbered}

When finished, click the *Submit Dataset* button at the bottom.\
If there are errors or missing fields, they will be highlighted.\
Correct those, and then try submitting again. When you are successful,
you should see a green banner with a link to the current dataset view.
Click the `X` to close that banner, if you want to continue editing
metadata.

![](images/editor-knb-11.png)

Success!

#### File and variable level metadata {.unnumbered}

The final major section of metadata concerns the structure and contents
of your data files. In this case, provide the names and descriptions of
the data contained in each file, as well as details of their internal
structure.

For example, for data tables, you'll need the name, label, and
definition of each variable in your file. Click the **Describe** button
to access a dialog to enter this information.

![](images/editor-knb-12.png)

The **Attributes** tab is where you enter variable (aka attribute)
information. In the case of tabular data (such as csv files) each column
is an attribute, thus there should be one attribute defined for every
column in your dataset. Attribute metadata includes:

-   variable name (for programs)
-   variable label (for display)

![](images/editor-knb-13.png)

-   variable definition (be specific)
-   type of measurement

![](images/editor-knb-14.png)

-   units & code definitions

![](images/editor-knb-15.png)

You'll need to add these definitions for every variable (column) in the
file. When done, click **Done**.

![](images/editor-knb-16.png)

Now the list of data files will show a green checkbox indicating that
you have full described that file's internal structure. Proceed with the
other CSV files, and then click **Submit Dataset** to save all of these
changes.

Note that attribute information is not relevant for data files that do
not contain variables, such as the R script in this example. Other
examples of data files that might not need attributes are images, pdfs,
and non-tabular text documents (such as readme files). The yellow circle
in the editor indicates that attributes have not been filled out for a
data file, and serves as a warning that they might be needed, depending
on the file.

![](images/editor-knb-17.png)

After you get the green success message, you can visit your dataset and
review all of the information that you provided. If you find any errors,
simply click **Edit** again to make changes.

#### Add workflow provenance {.unnumbered}

Understanding the relationships between files in a package is critically
important, especially as the number of files grows. Raw data are
transformed and integrated to produce derived data, that are often then
used in analysis and visualization code to produce final outputs. In
DataONE, we support structured descriptions of these relationships, so
one can see the flow of data from raw data to derived to outputs.

You add provenance by navigating to the data table descriptions, and
selecting the `Add` buttons to link the data and scripts that were used
in your computational workflow. On the left side, select the `Add`
circle to add an input data source to the filteredSpecies.csv file. This
starts building the provenance graph to explain the origin and history
of each data object.

![](images/editor-knb-18.png)

The linkage to the source dataset should appear.

![](images/editor-knb-19.png)

Then you can add the link to the source code that handled the conversion
between the data files by clicking on `Add` arrow and selecting the R
script:

![](images/editor-knb-20.png)

Select the R script and click "Done."

![](images/editor-knb-21.png)

![](images/editor-knb-22.png)

The diagram now shows the relationships among the data files and the R
script, so click **Submit** to save another version of the package.

![](images/editor-knb-23.png)

Et voilà! A beatifully preserved data package!
