## Working as Part of a Team

### Working in teams

Many aspects of the research enterprise today are collaborative and require you to work effectively as a member of a team. No matter their focus, highly effective teams share certain characteristics:

*   Right size
*   Diverse group of people with the right mix of skills, knowledge, and competencies
*   Aligned purpose and incentives
*   Effective organizational structure
*   Strong individual contributions
*   Supportive team processes and culture

### Aligning for success

Coming to a shared definition of success and understanding of the project scope is critical. It may be useful to write a short manifesto that articulates what you are doing, why and how.

Once the purpose is clear, then you need a clear and regularly updated work plan and timeline that articulate the group’s work streams and the roles, responsibilities and tasks of group members. Explore team members’ motivations for being involved in the work and try to match assignments and roles to individuals’ interests, skills and incentives. What are their personal and professional rewards; what do they consider exciting or cutting edge? If you will be collaborating with individuals from across different sectors (e.g., academia, government, NGOs, private sector), consider how their performance is evaluated and rewarded in their institutions. Does all or some of the planned work align with what they get paid to do? If not, are there ways to still tap their expertise? Varying career goals of participants can help you to match people and tasks, e.g., lead authorship on papers is generally most motivating to pre-tenure scientists. Your group will be much more productive if you invite people to discuss their needs openly and honestly and design the work to help them satisfy those needs.

These tools can help support the articulation and tracking of responsibilities and timelines:


*   [Responsibility assignment matrix (RACI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix)
*   [Gantt Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart)

There are many free online templates available for these, as well as various project management software platforms. Whatever you use, make it accessible to all team members so everyone can record and track progress. It’s more important to select a system that the majority of your team members are likely to use than to choose the “best” tool. In many cases, this will mean using the tools that are already familiar. See also section [3.4][Skills and Tools for Reproducible and Team Science] for more on collaboration tools.

### Culture, structure, and leadership

The success of team science endeavors hinges on the ongoing cultivation of a good collaborative culture, and interactions early on help set expectations and direction. As an early career researcher, your influence over the culture of your team may be limited. Nonetheless, you can help create the conditions that will enable effective collaboration by developing systems and practices for regular interaction and communication, seeking input from collaborators, asking for and offering support, and dealing with conflicts directly rather than hoping they will go away. Where you are leading aspects of the project, e.g., as the lead author of a paper, you can create your own mini team culture.

Some elements of an effective collaborative culture include:

*   Mutual respect, trust, and opportunities for social connection
*   Clear norms and expectations, e.g., for how conflicts will be handled and how credit will be shared and attributed
*   Clear data sharing and authorship guidelines: If your team spans diverse fields and/or sectors, members may have divergent perspectives, so it’s important to talk about this openly, early in the process, and revisit agreements regularly
*   Equal opportunities for participation that welcome all voices and contributions
*   Shared leadership: Each activity or task should have a clear objective and someone who is responsible for ensuring the group reaches that objective

#### Traditional and network mindsets

Collaborative work requires us to move in and out of what is known as a network mindset (versus a traditional mindset, which might apply, for example in a traditional lab setting or a solo project). It is the network mindset that sees the potential for “greater than the sum of the parts” solutions. Orienting from a network mindset we lean into uncertainty, trusting that useful outcomes may emerge from the collective intelligence of the network. Those outcomes include enhanced learning, new ideas, and new opportunities for collaborative research. It’s important to note, though, that there is a place for both the traditional and the network mindset. Neither is better than the other. The skill comes in knowing which is required and moving easily between them.

#### Resolving team conflict

Like all human endeavors, the research enterprise involves power and conflict. Many research organizations operate under a traditional hierarchical model, with power and decisionmaking authority increasing with rank. As an early career researcher, you’re near the bottom of that ladder. Power dynamics within research teams may also be affected by Implicit bias and systemic injustice towards people based on their age, gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, physical ability or other characteristics. Discrimination or harrassment based on these or other differences should not be tolerated. If you have experienced, witnessed, or are otherwise knowledgeable of harassment or discrimination you should report it (see section below).

While discrimination and harassment are unacceptable, other forms of conflict are virtually inevitable within teams, and if handled successfully can actually benefit the collaboration. The ability to navigate conflict in healthy and constructive ways is a key characteristic of high functioning teams and critical to your career success.

Conflict emerges from differences among people - the same differences that can make diverse teams so effective. In order to take full advantage of the varying skills, experiences, and perspectives of our teams, we have to be open to those differences, learn how to share constructive differences of opinion, and resolve negative conflicts before they turn into full blown disputes.


**Acknowledge the conflict** 

If you or your team are experiencing a conflict, the first step is to acknowledge (rather than ignore) that a negative conflict has emerged and then agree to a process for resolving the conflict that involves open communication with the person or people involved. 

When describing the conflict and the impact it is having on you, focus on specific observable behavior and events, not on personalities or generalities. Say “When <span style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span> happens, it has <span style="text-decoration:underline;">this impact </span>on me.” Avoid making up a story about the other person or their motivations. Stay on “your side of the net.” Ask for their perspective, “What was going on with you?”

**Understand the situation** 

Invite all parties to share their view of the situation. Take time to make sure everyone’s position is heard and understood. Work to get through the emotions to the true nature of the conflict. Listen carefully and ask questions to draw out the facts, assumptions, and beliefs behind each person’s position. Together, identify areas of agreement and disagreement until you have a shared understanding of the dispute. Prioritize which areas of conflict or disagreement are most important to address first. Encourage the parties involved to clearly state their requests and preferences.


**Engage in joint problem-solving to find a resolution** 

Building on the shared understanding of the situation, decide together how to make things better. If the group decides more analysis or discussion is needed, agree on what that’s going to look like. Lay out roles, responsibilities and a timeline, and commit to both the joint problem-solving process and its outcome. Start with the most important conflict. Focus on the future with positive intent.


**Tend the relationships, keep the communication flowing** 

Your work is not done when the conflict is resolved. You and other members took a risk in stepping into this process. Celebrate that bravery and its outcomes. Maintain open channels of communication to support ongoing trust building and the exchange of constructive differences of opinion. Cultivate opportunities for open and honest feedback among all team members.

#### Reporting harassment or discrimination

The National Science Foundation (NSF), which sponsors NEON, does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind, within the Foundation, at awardee organizations, field sites, or anywhere NSF-funded science and education are conducted. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI, https://nsf.gov/od/odi/index.jsp) is responsible for the NSF Awardee Civil Rights Compliance Program and is committed to ensuring NSF awardees can learn and explore science without having to tolerate discrimination or harassment.

Individuals who wish to report harassment or discrimination should contact programcomplaints@nsf.gov, call (703) 292-8020, or mail to ODI. ODI will confirm receipt of communications within 48 business hours. ODI will also explain rights and responsibilities of the individuals and discuss possible next steps, such as filing a formal complaint.

Please note, ODI will take appropriate steps to protect the names and other personally identifiable information of individuals who submit reports of harassment or discrimination consistent with NSF policy as well as the Privacy Act, FOIA, and other applicable federal law. NSF awardees may not retaliate against individuals who report harassment or discrimination; file harassment or discrimination complaints; participate in a harassment or discrimination complaint; or participate in compliance review as a witness, interviewee and other protected activities.
