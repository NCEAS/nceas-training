## Introduction

Processing large amounts of data with complex models can be time consuming.  New types of sensing means the scale of data collection today is massive. And modeled outputs can be large as well. For example, here's a 2 TB (that's Terabyte) set of modeled output data from [Ofir Levy et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.5063/F1Z899CZ) that models 15 environmental variables at hourly time scales for hundreds of years across a regular grid spanning a good chunk of North America:

![Levy et al. 2016. doi:10.5063/F1Z899CZ](images/levy-map.png)

There are over 400,000 individual netCDF files in the [Levy et al. microclimate data set](https://doi.org/10.5063/F1Z899CZ).  Processing them would benefit massively from parallelization.

Alternatively, think of remote sensing data.  Processing airborne hyperspectral data can involve processing each of hundreds of bands of data for each image in a flight path that is repeated many times over months and years.

## Why parallelism?

Much R code runs fast and fine on a single processor.  But at times, computations
can be:

- **cpu-bound**: Take too much cpu time
- **memory-bound**: Take too much memory
- **I/O-bound**: Take too much time to read/write from disk
- **network-bound**: Take too much time to transfer

To help with **cpu-bound** computations, one can take advantage of modern processor architectures that provide multiple cores on a single processor, and thereby enable multiple computations to take place at the same time. In addition, some machines ship with multiple processors, allowing large computations to occur across the entire set of those processors. Plus, these machines also have large amounts of memory to avoid **memory-bound** computing jobs.

## Processors (CPUs), Cores, and Threads

A modern CPU (Central Processing Unit) is at the heart of every computer.  While
traditional computers had a single CPU, modern computers can ship with mutliple 
processors, each of which in turn can contain multiple cores.  These processors and 
cores are available to perform computations. But, just what's the difference between 
processors and cores? A computer with one processor may still have 4 cores (quad-core), 
allowing 4 (or possibly more) computations to be executed at the same time.

+ [**Microprocessor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor):
an integrated circuit that contains the data processing logic and control for a computer. 

+ [**Multi-core processor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor):
a microprocessor containing multiple processing units (cores) on a single integrated circuit. Each core in a multi-core processor can execute program instructions at the same time. 

+ [**Process**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)):
an instance of a computer program (including instructions, memory, and other resources) that is executed on a microprocessor. 

+ [**Thread**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)):
a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of program instructions that can be executed independently, and is typically a component of a process. The threads in a process can be executed concurrently and typically share the same memory space. They are faster to create than a process.

+ [**Cluster**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster):
a set of multiple, physically distinct computing systems, each with its own microprocessors, memory, and storage resources, connected together by a (fast) network that allows the nodes to be viewed as a single system.

A typical modern computer has multiple cores, ranging from one or two in laptops
to thousands in high performance compute clusters.  Here we show four quad-core
processors for a total of 16 cores in this machine.

![](images/processors.png)

You can think of this as allowing 16 computations to happen at the same time. Theroetically, your computation would take 1/16 of the time (but only theoretically, more on that later).

Historically, many languages only utilized one processor, which makes them single-threaded.  Which is a shame, because the 2019 MacBook Pro that I am writing this on is much more powerful than that, and has mutliple cores that would support concurrent execution of multiple threads:

```bash
jones@powder:~$ sysctl hw.ncpu hw.physicalcpu
hw.ncpu: 12
hw.physicalcpu: 6
```

To interpret that output, this machine `powder` has 6 physical CPUs, each of which has
two processing cores, for a total of 12 cores for computation.  I'd sure like my computations to use all of that processing power.  Because its all on one machine, we can easily use *multicore* processing tools to make use of those cores. Now let's look at the computational server `included-crab` at NCEAS:

```bash
jones@included-crab:~$ lscpu | egrep 'CPU\(s\)|per core|per socket' 
CPU(s):                          88
On-line CPU(s) list:             0-87
Thread(s) per core:              1
Core(s) per socket:              1
NUMA node0 CPU(s):               0-87
```

Now that's more compute power!  `included-crab` has 384 GB of RAM, and ample storage. All still under the control of a single operating system.

Finally, maybe one of these [NSF-sponsored high performance computing clusters (HPC)](https://allocations.access-ci.org/resources) is looking attractive about now:

Note that these clusters have multiple nodes (hosts), and each host has multiple cores. So this is really multiple computers clustered together to act in a coordinated fashion, but each node runs its own copy of the operating system, and is in many ways independent of the other nodes in the cluster.  One way to use such a cluster would be to use just one of the nodes, and use a multi-core approach to parallelization to use all of the cores on that single machine.  But to truly make use of the whole cluster, one must use parallelization tools that let us spread out our computations across multiple host nodes in the cluster.

## When to parallelize

It's not as simple as it may seem. While in theory each added processor would linearly increase the throughput of a computation, there is overhead that reduces that efficiency.  For example, the code and, importantly, the data need to be copied to each additional CPU, and this takes time and bandwidth.  Plus, new processes and/or threads need to be created by the operating system, which also takes time.  This overhead reduces the efficiency enough that realistic performance gains are much less than theoretical, and usually do not scale linearly as a function of processing power. For example, if the time that a computation takes is short, then the overhead of setting up these additional resources may actually overwhelm any advantages of the additional processing power, and the computation could potentially take longer!

In addition, not all of a task can be parallelized. Depending on the proportion, the expected speedup can be significantly reduced.  Some propose that this may follow [Amdahl's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law), where the speedup of the computation (y-axis) is a function of both the number of cores (x-axis) and the proportion of the computation that can be parallelized (see colored lines):

```{r label="amdahl", echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
amdahl <- function(p, s) {
  return(1 / ( (1-p) + p/s  ))
}
doubles <- 2^(seq(0,16))
cpu_perf <- cbind(cpus = doubles, p50 = amdahl(.5, doubles))
cpu_perf <- cbind(cpu_perf, p75 = amdahl(.75, doubles))
cpu_perf <- cbind(cpu_perf, p85 = amdahl(.85, doubles))
cpu_perf <- cbind(cpu_perf, p90 = amdahl(.90, doubles))
cpu_perf <- cbind(cpu_perf, p95 = amdahl(.95, doubles))
#cpu_perf <- cbind(cpu_perf, p99 = amdahl(.99, doubles))
cpu_perf <- as.data.frame(cpu_perf)
cpu_perf <- cpu_perf %>% gather(prop, speedup, -cpus)
ggplot(cpu_perf, aes(cpus, speedup, color=prop)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Amdahl's Law")
```


So, its important to evaluate the computational efficiency of requests, and work to ensure that additional compute resources brought to bear will pay off in terms of increased work being done.  With that, let's do some parallel computing...

## Pleasingly Parallel task lists

When you have a list of repetitive tasks, you may be able to speed it up by adding more computing power.  If each task is completely independent of the others, then it is a prime candidate for executing those tasks in parallel, each on its own core.  For example, let's build a simple loop that uses sample with replacement to do a bootstrap analysis.  In this case, we select `bill_length_mm` and `species` from the `palmerpenguins` dataset, randomly subset it to 100 observations, and then iterate across 3,000 trials, each time resampling the observations with replacement.  We then run a logistic regression fitting species as a function of length, and record the coefficients for each trial to be returned. 

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
bill_length <- penguins %>% 
    select(species, bill_length_mm) %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    as.data.frame()
head(bill_length)
```

Given this data, we can use a general linear model to estimate bill length as a function of species, where we use a loop to bootstrap over repeated subsamples of this dataset.

```{r label="bootstrap-loop"}
trials <- 3000
res <- data.frame()
system.time({
  trial <- 1
  while(trial <= trials) {
    index <- sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE)
    result1 <- glm(bill_length[index,1]~bill_length[index,2], family=binomial(logit))
    r <- coefficients(result1)
    res <- rbind(res, r)
    trial <- trial + 1
  }
})
```

The issue with this loop is that we execute each trial sequentially, which means that only one of our processors on this machine are in use.  In order to exploit parallelism, we need to be able to dispatch our tasks as functions, with one task
going to each processor.  To do that, we need to convert our task to a function, and then use the `*apply()` family of R functions to apply that function to all of the members of a set.  In R, using `apply` used to be faster than the equivalent code in a loop, but now they are similar due to optimizations in R loop handling. However, using the function allows us to later take advantage of other approaches to parallelization.  Here's the same code rewritten to use `lapply()`, which applies a function to each of the members of a list (in this case the trials we want to run):

```{r label="bootstrap-lapply"}
boot_fx <- function(trial) {
  ind <- sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE)
  result1 <- glm(bill_length[ind,1]~bill_length[ind,2], family=binomial(logit))
  r <- coefficients(result1)
  res <- rbind(data.frame(), r)
}

trials <- seq(1, trials)
system.time({
  results <- lapply(trials, boot_fx)
})
```

## Approaches to parallelization
When parallelizing jobs, one can:

- Use the multiple cores on a local computer through `mclapply`
- Use multiple processors on local (and remote) machines using `makeCluster` and `clusterApply`

    - In this approach, one has to manually copy data and code to each cluster member using `clusterExport`
    - This is extra work, but sometimes gaining access to a large cluster is worth it
  
### Parallelize using: mclapply

The `parallel` library can be used to send tasks (encoded as function calls) to each of the processing cores on your machine in parallel.  This is done by using the `parallel::mclapply` function, which is analogous to `lapply`, but distributes the tasks to multiple processor cores. `mclapply` gathers up the responses from each of these function calls, and returns a list of responses that is the same length as the list or vector of input data (one return per input item). Now let's demonstrate with our bootstrap example. First, determine how many cores are available on this machine:

```{r label="kmeans-comparison"}
library(parallel)
numCores <- detectCores()
numCores
```

Then, using that, run our 3000 bootstrap samples with the same function, but this time parallel on those `r numCores` cores.

```{r label="bootstrap-mclapply"}
system.time({
  res_mca <- mclapply(trials, boot_fx, mc.cores = numCores)
})
```

### Parallelize using: foreach and doParallel

The normal `for` loop in R looks like:

```{r label="for-loop"}
for (i in 1:3) {
  print(sqrt(i))
}
```

The `foreach` method is similar, but uses the sequential `%do%` operator to indicate an expression to run. Note the difference in the returned data structure. 
```{r label="foreach-loop"}
library(foreach)
foreach (i=1:3) %do% {
  sqrt(i)
}
```

In addition, `foreach` supports a parallelizable operator `%dopar%` from the `doParallel` package. This allows each iteration through the loop to use different cores or different machines in a cluster.  Here, we demonstrate with using all the cores on the current machine:
```{r label="foreach-doParallel"}
library(foreach)
library(doParallel)
registerDoParallel(numCores)  # use multicore, set to the number of our cores
foreach (i=1:3) %dopar% {
  sqrt(i)
}

# To simplify output, foreach has the .combine parameter that can simplify return values

# Return a vector
foreach (i=1:3, .combine=c) %dopar% {
  sqrt(i)
}

# Return a data frame
foreach (i=1:3, .combine=rbind) %dopar% {
  sqrt(i)
}
```

The [doParallel vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doParallel/vignettes/gettingstartedParallel.pdf) on CRAN shows a much more realistic example, where one can use `%dopar% to parallelize a bootstrap analysis where a data set is resampled 10,000 times and the analysis is rerun on each sample, and then the results combined:

```{r label="foreach-bootstrap"}
# Let's use the iris data set to do a parallel bootstrap
# From the doParallel vignette, but slightly modified
trials <- 3000
system.time({
  r <- foreach(icount(trials), .combine=rbind) %dopar% {
    ind <- sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE)
    result1 <- glm(bill_length[ind,1]~bill_length[ind,2], family=binomial(logit))
    coefficients(result1)
  }
})

# And compare that to what it takes to do the same analysis in serial
system.time({
  r <- foreach(icount(trials), .combine=rbind) %do% {
    ind <- sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE)
    result1 <- glm(bill_length[ind,1]~bill_length[ind,2], family=binomial(logit))
    coefficients(result1)
  }
})

# When you're done, clean up the cluster
stopImplicitCluster()
```


## Summary

In this lesson, we showed examples of computing tasks that are likely limited by the number of CPU cores that can be applied, and we reviewed the architecture of computers to understand the relationship between CPU processors and cores.  Next, we reviewed the way in which traditional `for` loops in R can be rewritten as functions that are applied to a list serially using `lapply`, and then how the `parallel` package `mclapply` function can be substituted in order to utilize multiple cores on the local computer to speed up computations. Finally, we installed and reviewed the use of the `foreach` package with the `%dopar` operator to accomplish a similar parallelization using multiple cores.
