## Communicating your research

*"The ingredients of good science are obvious—novelty of research topic, comprehensive coverage of the relevant literature, good data, good analysis including strong statistical support, and a thought-provoking discussion. The ingredients of good science reporting are obvious—good organization, the appropriate use of tables and figures, the right length, writing to the intended audience— do not ignore the obvious" - Bourne 2005*

### Scholarly publications

Peer-reviewed publication remains a primary mechanism for direct and efficient communication of research findings. Other scholarly communications include abstracts, technical reports, books and book chapters. These communications are largely directed towards students and peers; individuals learning about or engaged in the process of scientific research whether in a university, non-profit, agency, commercial or other setting. Since postdoctoral researchers are typically experienced in scholarly publications by this point in their career, this section will focus on other forms of communication. However, researchers would benefit from reviewing the '10 Simple Rules' for writing research papers below (adapted from [Zhang 2014](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003453), published in [Budden and Michener, 2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-59928-1_14))

1. **Make it a Driving Force** "design a project with an ultimate paper firmly in mind”
2. **Less Is More** "fewer but more significant papers serve both the research community and one’s career better than more papers of less significance” 
3. **Pick the Right Audience** “This is critical for determining the organization of the paper and the level of detail of the story, so as to write the paper with the audience in mind.”
4. **Be Logical** “The foundation of ‘‘lively’’ writing for smooth reading is a sound and clear logic underlying the story of the paper.” “An effective tactic to help develop a sound logical flow is to imaginatively create a set of figures and tables, which will ultimately be developed from experimental results, and order them in a logical way based on the information flow through the experiments.”
5. **Be Thorough and Make It Complete** Present the central underlying hypotheses; interpret the insights gleaned from figures and tables and discuss their implications; provide sufficient context so the paper is self-contained; provide explicit results so readers do not need to perform their own calculations; and include self-contained figures and tables that are described in clear legends
6. **Be Concise** “the delivery of a message is more rigorous if the writing is precise and concise” 
7. **Be Artistic** “concentrate on spelling, grammar, usage, and a ‘‘lively’’ writing style that avoids successions of simple, boring, declarative sentences” 
8. **Be Your Own Judge** Review, revise and reiterate. “…put yourself completely in the shoes of a referee and scrutinize all the pieces—the significance of the work, the logic of the story, the correctness of the results and conclusions, the organization of the paper, and the presentation of the materials.”
9. **Test the Water in Your Own Backyard** “…collect feedback and critiques from others, e.g., colleagues and collaborators.”
10. **Build a Virtual Team of Collaborators** Treat reviewers as collaborators and respond objectively to their criticisms and recommendations. This may entail redoing research and thoroughly re-writing a paper.


### Visualizations

### Other communications

Communicating your research outside of peer-reviewed journal articles is increasingly common, and important. These non academic communications can reach a more broad and diverse audience than traditional publications (and should be tailored for specific audience groups accordingly), are not subject to the same pay-walls as journal articles, and can augment and amplify scholarly publications. For example, this twitter announcement from Dr Heather Kropp, providing a synopsis of their synthesis publication in Environmental Research (note the reference to NEON in the last comment).

Whether this communication occurs through blogs, social media, or via interviews with others, developing practices to refine your messaging is critical for successful communication.
