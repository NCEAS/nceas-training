### Introduction to reproducible research

Reproducibility is the hallmark of science, which is based on empirical observations 
coupled with explanatory models.  While reproducibility encompasses 
the full science lifecycle, and includes issues such as methodological consistency and
treatment of bias, in this course we will focus on **computational reproducibility**: 
the ability to document data, analyses, and models sufficiently for other researchers 
to be able to understand and ideally re-execute the computations that led to 
scientific results and conclusions.

#### What is needed for computational reproducibility? {-}

The first step towards addressing these issues is to be able to evaluate the data,
analyses, and models on which conclusions are drawn.  Under current practice, 
this can be difficult because data are typically unavailable, the method sections
of papers do not detail the computational approaches used, and analyses and models
are often conducted in graphical programs, or, when scripted analyses are employed,
the code is not available.

And yet, this is easily remedied.  Researchers can achieve computational 
reproducibility through open science approaches, including straightforward steps 
for archiving data and code openly along with the scientific workflows describing 
the provenance of scientific results (e.g., @hampton_tao_2015, @munafo_manifesto_2017).

#### Conceptualizing workflows {-}

Scientific workflows encapsulate all of the steps from data acquisition, cleaning,
transformation, integration, analysis, and visualization.

Workflows can range in detail from simple flowcharts 
to fully executable scripts. R scripts and python scripts are a textual form 
of a workflow, and when researchers publish specific versions of the scripts and 
data used in an analysis, it becomes far easier to repeat their computations and 
understand the provenance of their conclusions.

### Logging into the RStudio server

To help prevent us from spending most of this lesson remotely troubleshooting the myriad of issues that can arise when setting up the R, RStudio, and git environments, we have chosen to have everyone work on a remote server with all of the software you need installed. We will be using a special kind of RStudio just for servers called, aptly, RStudio Server. If you have never worked on a remove server before, you can think of it like working on a different computer via the internet. Note that the server has no knowledge of the files on your local filesystem, but it is easy to transfer files from the server to your local computer, and vice-versa, using the RStudio server interface.

Here are the instructions for logging in and getting set up:

#### Setup {- .setup}

You should have received an email prompting you to change your password for your server account. If you did not, please let one of the helpers know on Slack.

If you were able to successfully change your password, you can log in at: [https://included-crab.nceas.ucsb.edu/](https://included-crab.nceas.ucsb.edu/)

#### {-}

In this workshop, we are going to be using R projects to organize our work. An R project is tied to a directory on your local computer, and makes organizing your work and collaborating with others easier.

We are going to be doing nearly all of the work in this course in one project. Our version of RStudio server allows you to share projects with others. Sharing your project with the instructors of the course will allow for them to jump into your session and type along with you, should you encounter an error you cannot fix.

#### Setup {- .setup}

In your RStudio server session, follow these steps to set up your shared project:

* In the "File" menu, select "New Project"
* Click "New Directory"
* Click "New Project"
* Under "Directory name" type: `training_{USERNAME}`, eg: `training_jclark`
* Leave "Create Project as subdirectory of:" set to `~`
* Click "Create Project"

Your Rstudio should now open your project. To share your project with the instructor team, locate the "project switcher" dropdown menu in the upper right of your RStudio window. This dropdown has the name if your project (eg: `training_clark`), and a dropdown arrow. Click the dropdown menu, then "Share Project." When the dialog box pops up, add the following usernames to your project:

* jclark
* jones
* mecum
* jasminelai
* erinmcclean
* scsik
* cwbeltz

Once those names show up in the list, click "OK".

### Setting up the R environment on your local computer

Even though we have you working on a remote server, we still recommend that you set up your own computer with the following software so that you are ready to take the tools you learn in the course into your daily work.

#### R Version {-}

We will use R version 4.0.2, which you can download and install from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com). To check your version, run this in your RStudio console:

```{r rversion, eval=FALSE}
R.version$version.string
```

If you have R version 4.0.0 that will likely work fine as well.

#### RStudio Version {-}

We will be using RStudio version 1.3.1000 or later, which you can download and install [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) To check your RStudio version, run the following in your RStudio console:

```{r rstudio-version, eval=FALSE}
RStudio.Version()$version
```

If the output of this does not say `1.2.500` or higher, you should update your RStudio. Do this by selecting Help -> Check for Updates and follow the prompts.

#### Package installation {-}

Run the following lines to check that all of the packages we need for the training are installed on your computer.

```{r package-install, eval = FALSE}
packages <- c("dplyr", "tidyr", "readr", "devtools", "usethis", "roxygen2", "leaflet", "ggplot2", "DT", "scales", "shiny", "sf", "ggmap", "broom", "captioner", "MASS")

for (package in packages) { if (!(package %in% installed.packages())) { install.packages(package) } }
rm(packages) #remove variable from workspace

# Now upgrade any out-of-date packages
update.packages(ask=FALSE)
```

If you haven't installed all of the packages, this will automatically start installing them. If they are installed, it won't do anything.

Next, create a new R Markdown (File -> New File -> R Markdown). If you have never made an R Markdown document before, a dialog box will pop up asking if you wish to install the required packages. Click yes.

At this point, RStudio and R should be all set up.

#### Setting up git {-}

If you haven't already, go to [github.com](http://github.com) and create an account. If you haven't downloaded git already, you can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Before using git, you need to tell it who you are, also known as setting the global options. The only way to do this is through the command line. Newer versions of RStudio have a nice feature where you can open a terminal window in your RStudio session. Do this by selecting Tools -> Terminal -> New Terminal.

A terminal tab should now be open where your console usually is. 

To see if you aleady have your name and email options set, use this command from the terminal:

```{sh git-config, eval=FALSE}
git config --global --list | grep user
```

To set the global options, type the following into the command prompt, with your actual name, and press enter:

```{sh git-name, eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.name "Matt Jones"
```

Next, enter the following line, with the email address you used when you created your account on github.com:

```{sh git-email, eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.email "gitcode@magisa.org"
```

Note that these lines need to be run one at a time.

Finally, check to make sure everything looks correct by entering these commands, which will return the options that you have set.

```{sh git-list, eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

##### Note for Windows Users {-}

If you get "command not found" (or similar) when you try these steps through the RStudio terminal tab, you may need to set the type of terminal that gets launched by RStudio. Under some git install scenarios, the git executable may not be available to the default terminal type. Follow the instructions on the RStudio site for [Windows specific terminal options](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal#appendixe). In particular, you should choose "New Terminals open with Git Bash" in the Terminal options (`Tools->Global Options->Terminal`).

In addition, some versions of windows have difficulty with the command line if you are using an account name with spaces in it (such as "Matt Jones", rather than something like "mbjones").  You may need to use an account name without spaces.

#### Updating a previous R installation {-}

**This is useful for users who already have R with some packages installed and need to upgrade R, but don't want to lose packages.** If you have never installed R or any R packages before, you can skip this section.

If you already have R installed, but need to update, and don't want to lose your packages, these two R functions can help you. The first will save all of your packages to a file. The second loads the packages from the file and installs packages that are missing.

Save this script to a file (eg `package_update.R`).

```{r, eval = F}
#' Save R packages to a file. Useful when updating R version
#'
#' @param path path to rda file to save packages to. eg: installed_old.rda
save_packages <- function(path){
    tmp <- installed.packages()
    installedpkgs <- as.vector(tmp[is.na(tmp[,"Priority"]), 1])
    save(installedpkgs, file = path)
}

#' Update packages from a file. Useful when updating R version
#' 
#' @param path path to rda file where packages were saved
update_packages <- function(path){
    tmp <- new.env()
    installedpkgs <- load(file = path, envir = tmp)
    installedpkgs <- tmp[[ls(tmp)[1]]]
    tmp <- installed.packages()

    installedpkgs.new <- as.vector(tmp[is.na(tmp[,"Priority"]), 1])
    missing <- setdiff(installedpkgs, installedpkgs.new)
    install.packages(missing)
    update.packages(ask=FALSE)
}
```

Source the file that you saved above (eg: `source(package_update.R)`). Then, run the `save_packages` function.

```{r, eval = F}
save_packages("installed.rda")
```

Then quit R, go to [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com), and install the latest version of R. 

Source the R script that you saved above again (eg: `source(package_update.R)`), and then run:

```{r, eval = F}
update_packages("installed.rda")
```

This should install all of your R packages that you had before you upgraded.
