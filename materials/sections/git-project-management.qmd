## Exercise: Practice creating informative READMEs

You can do this either for the training_username repo, or the Lobster Report repo (make sure just one of you edits this one) or edit a personal repo from one of your projects. Make sure to include the 6 core elements:

- [ ] A short, but descriptive title
- [ ] A brief explanation of the repository’s purpose
- [ ] A concise description of what’s housed in the repository
- [ ] Details regarding data access
- [ ] A list of authors or contributors (for collaborative work)
- [ ] References / acknowledgements
