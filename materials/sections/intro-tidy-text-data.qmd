## What is text data?

Text data is information stored as character or string data types. It comes in various different forms including books, emails, social media posts, interview transcripts, newspapers, government reports, and much more.

### How do we talk about text data?

Here is a list of text data or text analysis terms we'll be referring to throughout this lesson. Note this is not a comprehensive list of text analysis terms that are used beyond this lesson.

| Term                              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Corpus (corpora, plural)          | Collection or database of text or multiple texts. These types of objects typically contain raw strings annotated with additional metadata and details.                                           |
| Document-term matrix              | Represents the relationship between terms and documents, where each row stands for a term and each column for a document, and an entry is the number of occurrences of the term in the document. |
| Natural Language Processing (NLP) | NLP is an interdisciplinary field used in computer science, data science, linguistics, and others to analyze, categorize, and work with computerized text.                                       |
| String                            | Specific type of data whose values are enclosed within a set of quotes. Typically values or elements are characters (e.g. "Hello World!").                                                       |
| Text analysis                     | The process of deriving high-quality information or patterns from text through evaluation and interpretation of the output. Also referred to as "text mining" or "text analytics".               |
| Token                             | A meaningful unit of text, such as a word, to use for analysis.                                                                                                                                  |
| Tokenization                      | The process of splitting text into tokens.                                                                                                                                                       |

### How is text data used in the environmental field?

As our knowledge about the environmental world grows, researchers will need new computational approaches for working with text data because reading and identifying all the relevant literature for literature syntheses is becoming an increasingly difficult task.

Beyond literature syntheses, quantitative text analysis tools are extremely valuable for efficiently extracting information from texts and other text mining or text analysis tasks. 

## What is tidy text data?

Let's recall what are the three tidy data principles:

1.  Every column is a variable.
2.  Every row is an observation.
3.  Every cell is a single value.

Keeping that in mind, Silge and Robinson define the tidy text format as **being a table with one-token-per-row**.

This one-token-per-row structure is in contrast to the ways text is often stored in current analyses, perhaps as strings or in a document-term matrix.

For tidy text mining, the token that is stored in each row is most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram, sentence, or paragraph.

By using tidy data principles, we can apply many "tidy" R packages including dpylr, tidyr, ggplot2, and more.

### What is the `tidytext` R package?

### PROJECT GUTENBERG - practice putting text data in tidy text format using classic horror books

Text analysis workflow using tidy data principles

```{r}
library(gutenbergr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidytext)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# get id number
gutenberg_works(title == "Dracula")

dracula_corp <- gutenberg_download(345)

tidy_dracula <- dracula_corp %>% 
    unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
    anti_join(stop_words, by = "word")

tidy_dracula %>% 
    count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# get id number
gutenberg_works(title == "Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus")

frank_corp <- gutenberg_download(84)

tidy_frank <- frank_corp %>% 
    unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
    anti_join(stop_words, by = "word")

tidy_frank %>% 
    count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# get id number
gutenberg_works(title == "Carmilla")

carmilla_corp <- gutenberg_download(10007)

tidy_carmilla <- carmilla_corp %>% 
    unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
    anti_join(stop_words, by = "word")

tidy_carmilla %>% 
    count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# get id number
gutenberg_works(title == "Asleep in Armageddon")

# text data
bradbury_corp <- gutenberg_download(63827)

# tidy text
tidy_bradbury <- bradbury_corp %>% 
    unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
    anti_join(stop_words, by = "word")

# summarized text
count_bradbury <- tidy_bradbury %>%
    count(word) %>% 
    slice_max(n = 10, order_by = n)

# visualize text
ggplot(data = count_bradbury, aes(n, reorder(word, n))) +
  geom_col()
```

## Unstructured text data

typically raw text = unstructured  

## Structured text data

## Where can we find it and access it?

## How do we read in text data into R?

## Note about python

python has many powerful packages and tools for running analyses like NLP
