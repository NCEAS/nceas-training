## Open Data Ethics

Developed by the Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the
Arctic (ELOKA) and Navigating the New Arctic Community Office
(NNA-CO).

#### Introduction

This part of the training offers an introduction to ethics in the
context of open science. It was developed with input from ELOKA and
the NNA-CO, and is a work-in-progress – this is the first time we are
offering this training. The training introduces ethics issues in a
broad way and includes discussion of social science data and open
science, but the majority of the section focuses on issues related to
research with, by, and for Indigenous communities. We recognize that
there is a need for more in-depth training and focus on open science
for social scientists and others who are not engaging with Indigenous
Knowledge holders and Indigenous communities, and hope to develop
further resources in this area in the future. Many of the data
stewardship practices that have been identified as good practices
through Indigenous Data Sovereignty framework development are also
relevant for those working with Arctic communities that are not
Indigenous, although the rights frameworks and collective ownership is
specific to the Indigenous context.  

The examples we include in this training are primarily drawn from the
North American research context. In future trainings, we plan to
expand and include examples from other Indigenous Arctic contexts. We
welcome suggestions and resources that would strengthen this training
for audiences outside of North America.  

We also recognize the importance of trainings on Indigenous data
sovereignty and ethics that are being developed and facilitated by
Indigenous organizations and facilitators. In this training we offer
some introductory material but there is much more depth offered in IDS
specific trainings. We include some suggestions of organizations
offering further training in the “resources” section and encourage
participants to seek out these opportunities to deepen their
understanding.  


#### Equity issues in open science

Arctic communities (defined based on geographic location in the
Arctic/sub-Arctic) are involved in research in diverse ways - as hosts
to visiting or non-local researchers, as well as “home” to community
researchers who are leading or collaborating on research
projects. Over the past decades, community voices of discontent with
standard research practices that are often exclusive and perpetuate
inequities have grown stronger. The Arctic research community (defined
more broadly as the range of institutions, organizations, researchers
and local communities involved in research) is in the midst of a
complex conversation about equity in research aimed at transforming
research practice to make it more equitable and inclusive.  

One of the drivers of community concerns is the colonial practice of
extracting knowledge from a place or group of people without respect
for local norms of relationship with people and place and without an
ethical commitment to sharing and making benefits of knowledge
accessible and accountable to that place. Such approaches to knowledge
and data extraction follow hundreds of years of exploration and
research that viewed science as a tool of “Enlightenment” yet focused
exclusively on benefits to White, European (or “southern” from an
Arctic community perspective) researchers and scientists. This
prioritization of non-local perspectives and needs (to Arctic
communities) continues in Arctic research.  

Open science is ostensibly about making access to data and knowledge
more equitable and open and enabling reproducible research. Because it
is being implemented within a social and institutional context that
continues to perpetuate inequities in research, however, there are
significant challenges remaining to ethically and equitably
implementing open science practices. Here are some examples:  

* Many Open Science tools and practices (e.g. GitHub, non-proprietary
  software) have been adopted from software development, and are not
  familiar to many, even physical, scientists. This makes barriers to
  implementation of open science and participation in open science
  practices higher for some than for others.  

* Some of the main focus areas of open science (making sure data is
  archived in a clean and reusable format, open access publication)
  are still not accessible for Arctic residents and others who are not
  already situated within an academic environment. Open science
  assumes access to tools and infrastructure, such as computers that
  have reliable and low-cost or subsidized internet access.  

* These structural inequalities extend even within the
  academy. Researchers and academics based in lower-income countries
  have fewer provided resources and sources of support to pay for open
  access fees and face greater challenges in adopting open science
  practices.

* The emphasis of open science on stakeholder and rights holder
  engagement and knowledge co-production also creates unintended
  challenges for Arctic communities. For example, when the National
  Science Foundation’s Navigating the New Arctic initiative, which
  brought millions of additional funds to Arctic research, suggested
  that research projects incorporate co-production and collaboration
  with Arctic communities, community representatives reported being
  inundated with requests from researchers. Perhaps because NNA was
  designed, in part, to bring new researchers and disciplines into
  Arctic research, many of these requests were made without adequate
  regard for recognized good practices for community engagement (such
  as the importance of building relationships, reaching out very early
  for input; communicating “early and often;” and incorporating
  significant resources for community participants’ time and knowledge
  into project budgets, among other things). As a letter to NSF
  written by Kawerak, the Association of Village Council Presidents,
  the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island, and the Bering Sea Elders
  Group emphasized, without adequate attention to these practices as
  well as an emphasis on topics that communities have identified as
  important, research will not serve community partners and will fail
  to achieve its broader impact goals. (See also the 2021 update
  letter from the same organizations).
