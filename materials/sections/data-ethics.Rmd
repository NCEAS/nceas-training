## Open Data Ethics

Developed by the [Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the
Arctic (ELOKA)](https://eloka-arctic.org/) and [Navigating the New Arctic Community Office
(NNA-CO)](https://nna-co.org/).

### Introduction

This part of the training offers an introduction to ethics in the
context of open science. It was developed with input from ELOKA and
the NNA-CO, and is a work-in-progress – this is the first time we are
offering this training. The training introduces ethics issues in a
broad way and includes discussion of social science data and open
science, but the majority of the section focuses on issues related to
research with, by, and for Indigenous communities. We recognize that
there is a need for more in-depth training and focus on open science
for social scientists and others who are not engaging with Indigenous
Knowledge holders and Indigenous communities, and hope to develop
further resources in this area in the future. **Many of the data
stewardship practices that have been identified as good practices
through Indigenous Data Sovereignty framework development are also
relevant for those working with Arctic communities that are not
Indigenous, although the rights frameworks and collective ownership is
specific to the Indigenous context.**

The examples we include in this training are primarily drawn from the
North American research context. In future trainings, we plan to
expand and include examples from other Indigenous Arctic contexts. **We
welcome suggestions and resources that would strengthen this training
for audiences outside of North America.**  

We also recognize the importance of trainings on Indigenous data
sovereignty and ethics that are being developed and facilitated by
Indigenous organizations and facilitators. In this training we offer
some introductory material but there is much more depth offered in IDS
specific trainings. We include some suggestions of organizations
offering further training in the “resources” section and encourage
participants to seek out these opportunities to deepen their
understanding.  And there are several sessions this week with some of
the authors of the frameworks and protocols that will be discussed,
including:

 * Maui Hudson (Indigenous Data Sovereignty): Community-Driven
   Observations and Indigenous Perspectives (Wednesday, March 30)  
 * Jane Anderson (Local Contexts/TK labels): Data Sharing (Thursday,
   March 31)  



### Equity issues in open science

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics01.png)

Arctic communities (defined as a place and the people who live there,
based on geographic location in the Arctic/sub-Arctic) are involved in
research in diverse ways - as hosts to visiting or non-local
researchers, as well as “home” to community researchers who are
leading or collaborating on research projects. Over the past decades,
community voices of discontent with standard research practices that
are often exclusive and perpetuate inequities have grown stronger. The
Arctic research community (defined more broadly as the range of
institutions, organizations, researchers and local communities
involved in research) is in the midst of a complex conversation about
equity in research aimed at transforming research practice to make it
more equitable and inclusive.

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics02.png)

**One of the drivers of community concerns is the colonial practice of
extracting knowledge from a place or group of people without respect
for local norms of relationship with people and place, and without an
ethical commitment to sharing and making benefits of knowledge
accessible and accountable to that place.** Such approaches to knowledge
and data extraction follow hundreds of years of exploration and
research that viewed science as a tool of “Enlightenment” yet focused
exclusively on benefits to White, European (or “southern” from an
Arctic community perspective) researchers and scientists. This
prioritization of non-local perspectives and needs (to Arctic
communities) continues in Arctic research.

**One result of this approach to research has been a lack of access for
Arctic residents to the data and knowledge that have resulted from
research conducted in their own communities.** Much of this data was
stored in the personal files or hard drives of researchers, or in
archives located in urban centers far from the Arctic.

Open science is ostensibly about making access to data and knowledge
more equitable and open and enabling reproducible research. These are
laudable goals and on the surface, could provide a counterbalance to
traditional approaches that limited Arctic community members’ access
to research data and knowledge. Because it is being implemented within
a social and institutional context that continues to perpetuate
inequities in research, however, **there are significant challenges
remaining to ethically and equitably implementing open science
practices.**

Here are some examples of impediments to ethical and equitable
implementation of open science:  

* Many Open Science tools and practices (e.g. GitHub, non-proprietary
  software) have been adopted from software development, and are not
  familiar to many, even physical, scientists. This makes barriers to
  implementation of open science and participation in open science
  practices higher for some than for others.  

* Some of the main focus areas of open science (making sure data is
  archived in a clean and reusable format, open access publication)
  are still not accessible for Arctic residents and others who are not
  already situated within an academic environment. Open science
  assumes access to tools and infrastructure, such as computers that
  have reliable and low-cost or subsidized internet access.  

* These structural inequalities extend even within the
  academy. Researchers and academics based in lower-income countries
  have fewer provided resources and sources of support to pay for open
  access fees and [face greater challenges in adopting open science
  practices](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00724-0?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20220317&utm_source=nature_etoc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20220317&sap-outbound-id=B4EAD742973291804C3AEF5A15DD13806C9F2C30).

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics03.png)

* The emphasis of open science on stakeholder and rights holder
  engagement and knowledge co-production also creates unintended
  challenges for Arctic communities. For example, when the National
  Science Foundation’s Navigating the New Arctic initiative, which
  brought millions of additional funds to Arctic research, suggested
  that research projects incorporate co-production and collaboration
  with Arctic communities, community representatives reported being
  inundated with requests from researchers. Perhaps because NNA was
  designed, in part, to bring new researchers and disciplines into
  Arctic research, many of these requests were made without adequate
  regard for recognized good practices for community engagement (such
  as the importance of building relationships, reaching out very early
  for input; communicating “early and often;” and incorporating
  significant resources for community participants’ time and knowledge
  into project budgets, among other things). As a [letter to NSF](https://kawerak.org/download/navigating-the-new-arctic-program-comment-letter/)
  written by Kawerak, the Association of Village Council Presidents,
  the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island, and the Bering Sea Elders
  Group emphasized, without adequate attention to these practices as
  well as an emphasis on topics that communities have identified as
  important, research will not serve community partners and will fail
  to achieve its broader impact goals. (See also the [2021 update
  letter](https://kawerak.org/download/dec-2021-nna-follow-up-letter/) from the same organizations).  

### Social science and open data

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics04.png)

In addition to these equity related challenges in promoting open
access, there are also *different disciplinary norms and requirements*
that can create challenges for the adoption of open science
practices. For example, traditional social science methods training
and IRB processes emphasize confidentiality and privacy. Social
scientists generally lack access to training about benefits of sharing
data. On the other hand, social scientists are often trained to be
attuned to issues of equity and access, including issues related to
information equity. Those who lack this background may not give
adequate attention or time to the process of partnering with
communities. The [Arctic Horizons Report](https://jeffersoninst.org/sites/default/files/Arctic%20Horizons%20Final%20Report%281%29.pdf) reviewed challenges around
social science data management. In 2020, a [workshop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vv054wQNaQDH6mm5Eit2fQZT-8U-G0vq/view) organized by the
Arctic Data Center reviewed some of the challenges for sharing and
reusing social science data, including:

* Data heterogeneity, including “unstructured” data that is not always
  well supported by data repositories;  
* A dearth of metadata support for social sciences, with repositories
  not always offering relevant metadata fields;  
* A lack of “formal vocabularies” that limits findability of social
science data in searches; Limited training and support in data
management practices for social scientists; limited examples using
social science data in interdisciplinary trainings.  

In addition to these challenges, a number of broader concerns about
sharing data were identified, including:

* Concerns about proper handling of sensitive data; importance of
  upholding IRB and ethics requirements, data sharing/use agreements;  
* Importance of context - researchers may feel that data reuse is too
difficult given lack of contextual knowledge;  
* Concerns about upholding Indigenous data sovereignty.  


### Open (and other) data challenges for Indigenous Peoples

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics05.png)

The introduction of open data requirements has raised concerns about
how open data objectives such as making data freely available for use
and reuse may conflict with Indigenous Data Sovereignty and the right
of Indigenous peoples to govern their data (Rainie et al. 2019:
301). Stephanie Carroll (formerly Rainie) and colleagues (2019) have
summarized some of the data challenges for Indigenous Peoples,
including:

* **Data collection invisibility and bias**  

  + Insufficient involvement of Indigenous Peoples in broader
  decisions/discussions about data governance, including decisions
  about what data is collected, when, how, and by whom, as well as
  involvement in global data governance bodies.

  + __Even if Indigenous peoples are not part of data collection, if the
  data is collected on Indigenous lands and could be used to support
  decisions that impact these lands, animals, or Indigenous peoples,
  they should be part of decision-making about that data.__
  
* **Data access, use, and interpretation, including**:

  + Insufficient availability of data about Indigenous peoples - gaps
in national data collection

  + Challenges in data access (infrastructure and training); accessing
  and utilizing data from multiple sources given time and staffing
  limitations (McBride N.D.)
  
  + Data collected from a “deficit” lens - reinforces perception of
dysfunction, leading to bias and misrepresentation.

  + Open data movement prioritizes making data available for
  reuse. However, there are concerns about secondary analysis of
  Indigenous data given the importance of context to
  understanding/interpreting Indigenous data and emphasis on building
  and maintaining relationships in Indigeous research (Burrage 2021).
  
  + __Important for researchers generating data that they hope will be
  useful to Indigenous communities to be aware of ethical frameworks
  for working with/sharing data and partnering with communities.__
  
* **Data ownership and appropriation**

  + Digitization of data/“big data” - the context surrounding data is
  often very important to Indigenous Knowledge and data. The
  digitization of data raises concerns about how and to what extent
  this context can be preserved.  

  + Individual vs. collective rights. Data ownership is often focused
  on individual rights (both in protection of sensitive data as well
  as in intellectual property rights), while Indigenous peoples have
  both individual and collective rights in relation to data.

  * __All requests for data contributions, clarification, or
    informational resources are requests for collaboration and should
    be treated with the same level of importance as larger projects
    (Murphy 2019).__


### The role of IRBs, funding agencies, and Indigenous data

In the **United States**, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs; in **Canada**
they are referred to as Research Ethics Boards or REBs) focus on
ensuring ethical treatment and protection of research subjects with a
particular focus on vulnerable populations and ethical management of
data. For projects proposing research that involves Indigenous peoples
in the United States, IRBs will often refer the review to Tribal IRBs,
which are research review boards established and implemented directly
by Tribal Nations. Tribal IRBs reflect and respond to community needs,
changes in research, and revisions to research policy (Around Him et
al. 2019). Oversight mechanisms range from federally registered review
bodies and policy development to community-specific frameworks and
approaches (see Around Him et al. 2019 for differentiation,
justification and authority).

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics06.png)

In addition to IRB review, universities require ethics training for
researchers who are doing research with human subjects, including
Indigenous Peoples.  Many universities use the web-based, third-party
[CITI training program](https://about.citiprogram.org/), which offers different short courses.  A basic
training course for social and behavioral science researchers covers
the history of ethical misconduct in research, how human subjects
research is defined, federal regulations that govern research
practice, assessing risk, informed consent, privacy and
confidentiality, and ethics requirements for different categories of
vulnerable populations including prisoners and children.  While the
CITI human subjects trainings touch on topics related to Indigenous
peoples, they are not at all comprehensive. A CITI webinar, “[Research
with Native American Communities: Important Considerations when
Applying Federal Regulations](https://about.citiprogram.org/news/new-webinar-available-research-with-native-american-communities-important-considerations-when-applying-federal-regulations/)” introduces more topics.  The r-ETHICS
training ([Ethics Training for Health in Indigenous Communities Study](http://iwri.org/research/ethics/))
is starting to become an acceptable, recognizable CITI addition for
IRB training by tribal entities.

Specific **universities** have adopted tribal consultation policies (such
as the Arizona Board of Regents’ (ABOR) Tribal Consultation policy
(1-118) adopted in 2016; University of Wisconsin System Board of
Regents tribal consultation policy adopted in 2021; Washington State
University [EP 41](https://policies.wsu.edu/prf/index/manuals/executive-policy-manual-contents/ep41-policy-on-tribal-engagement-consultation-and-consent-for-joint-wsu-tribal-research-activities-and-projects/) adopted in 2021). These policies highlight where
consultation is expected/required and what the process should be
(Marley 2019).

In the United States, the [Inter-Agency Arctic Research Policy Committee has established the Principles for Conducting Research in the Arctic](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/arctic/conduct.jsp) (2018) with input from the  Arctic research community, which are:

- Be Accountable
- Establish Effective Communication
- Respect Indigenous Knowledge and Cultures
- Build and Sustain Relationships
- Pursue Responsible Environmental Stewardship

IRBs are not necessarily aware of these principles but national funding agencies may use them to inform proposal reviewers about expectations for research projects that work with Arctic communities.

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics07.png)

In **Canada**, funding agencies have established the **Tri-Council Policy
Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans**; [Chapter 9](https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/tcps2-eptc2_2018_chapter9-chapitre9.html)
focuses on research involving First Nations, Inuit and Metis. The
chapter points to the importance of addressing issues regarding access
to data and use of data with involved communities and suggests using a
research agreement to establish any limits on data use and sharing,
provisions to offer the opportunity for research participants and
collaborators to review reports and publications prior to
dissemination/publication, and to include provisions for any
anticipated secondary use of information.

The Tri-Council Statement has resulted in **direct modifications to
institutional-level REB (Canada) processes and procedures, such as
incorporation of dedicated sections focusing on Indigenous research
ethics within University protocols**. For example, the “Indigenous
Peoples and Community Engagement” section of an REB application at a
Canadian university asks researchers to “**Describe arrangements for the
participating community’s/ies’ ownership and/or sharing of project
data and findings**, including the OCAP principles” (see below for more on OCAP).


### Indigenous data governance and sovereignty

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics08.png)

**All governing entities, whether national, state, local, or tribal,
need access to good, current, relevant data in order to make policy,
planning, and programmatic decisions.** Indigenous nations and
organizations have had to push for data about their peoples and
communities to be collected and shared in ethical and culturally
appropriate ways, and they have also had to fight for resources and
capacity to develop and lead their own research programs.

#### Indigenous data definitions: {.exercise}

**Indigenous data sovereignty** “...refers to the right of Indigenous
peoples to govern the collection, ownership, and application of data
about Indigenous communities, peoples, lands, and resources (Rainie et
al. 2019). These governance rights apply “regardless of where/by whom
data is held (Rainie et al. 2019).

Some Indigenous individuals and communities have expressed
dissatisfaction with the term “data” as being too narrowly focused and
abstract to represent the embedded and holistic nature of knowledge in
Indigenous communities. **Knowledge sovereignty** is a related term that
has a similar meaning but is framed more broadly, and has been defined
as:

“Tribal communities having control over the documentation and
production of knowledge (such as through research activities) which
relate to Alaska Native people and the resources they steward and
depend on” (Kawerak 2021).

**Indigenous data** is “data in a wide variety of formats inclusive of
digital data and data as knowledge and information. It encompasses
data, information, and knowledge about Indigenous individuals,
collectives, entities, lifeways, cultures, lands, and resources.”
(Rainie et al. 2019)

**Indigenous data governance** is “The entitlement to determine how
Indigenous data is governed and stewarded” (Rainie et al. 2019)



### IDS Frameworks

There has been increasing emphasis on development of frameworks to
support ethical research and data stewardship grounded in Indigenous
understandings and world views. The emergence of national and global
networks focusing on Indigenous data sovereignty has supported the
development of some of these frameworks. For example, the [Global
Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA)](https://www.gida-global.org/whoweare) developed the CARE principles in
response to the emergence of the FAIR principles. CARE is a set of
high-level principles that are broad enough to encompass more specific
frameworks and principles developed by International and national
Indigenous networks, organizations, and Tribes. This alliance is
supported by three national networks, the [United States Indigenous
Data Sovereignty Network (USIDSN)](https://usindigenousdata.org/), [Te Mana Raraunga Maori Data
Sovereignty Network](https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/), and the [Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective](https://www.maiamnayriwingara.org/key-principles). The latter networks each
have worked within their respective national contexts to develop IDS
principles at a “mid-level.”

These frameworks are being developed at different governance levels,
from “high level” frameworks that are global in scale and therefore
more general to mid-level frameworks that are developed at a national
scale or by a subset of Indigenous Peoples/Nations (such as
circumpolar Inuit or Inuit within the national level in Canada), to
foundational level frameworks that are developed at the Tribal or
community scale.

It is important for researchers to be aware of the different
frameworks that can inform and guide ethical research practice and
data management. Frameworks developed at the high or mid-level do not
replace foundational frameworks. In the absence of a written framework
at the tribal/community scale, the practices of strong consultation
and engagement outlined in mid-level frameworks can help inform the
development of an ethical approach.

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics09.png)

**High level frameworks in support of IDS:**

* The **UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**, which
recognizes the collective rights of Indigenous peoples. **Article 18** of
UNDRIP **recognizes the right of Indigenous Peoples to participate in
decision-making** about matters that affect their rights; **Article 19**
**recognizes the requirement for states to consult and cooperate with
Indigenous Peoples to gain their Free Prior and Informed Consent** on
legislation that affects them. Other international protocols such as
**Nagoya Protocol** on access and benefit sharing and the **Cartagena
Protocol on Biosafety** (UNCBD) also recognize Indigenous rights with
reference to intellectual property and the right to benefit from
Indigenous knowledge and data as the owners/stewards of that data.

* [CARE principles](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/5da9f4479ecab221ce848fb2/1571419335217/CARE+Principles_One+Pagers+FINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf) were developed to accompany the FAIR Principles
and guide their implementation in relation to Indigenous data in a way
that is “people and purpose oriented.” They were developed by the RDA International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group and released by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance in September 2019.  The CARE Principles stand for:

    - **Collective Benefit** - Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data for:
        - Inclusive development/innovation  
    	- Improved governance and citizen engagement  
    	- Equitable outcomes
    	
    - **Authority to Control** - Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous lands, territories, resources, knowledges and geographical indicators, are represented and identified within data.
        - Recognizing Indigenous rights (individual and collective) and interests
        - Data for governance
        - Governance of data

    - **Responsibility** - Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit. Accountability requires meaningful and openly available evidence of these efforts and the benefits accruing to Indigenous Peoples.
        - For positive relationships
        - For expanding capability and capacity (enhancing digital
        literacy and digital infrastructure)
        - For Indigenous languages and worldviews (sharing data in Indigenous languages)
        
    - **Ethics** - Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.
        - Minimizing harm/maximizing benefit - not using a “deficit
        lens” that conceives of and portrays Indigenous communities as
        dysfunctional, lacking solutions, and in need of
        intervention. For researchers, adopting a deficit lens can
        lead to collection of only a subset of data while excluding
        other data and information that might identify solutions,
        innovations, and sources of resilience from within Indigenous
        communities. For policy makers, a deficit lens can lead to
        harmful interventions framed as “helping.”  
        - For justice - addressing power imbalances and equity  
        - For future use - acknowledging potential future use/future
        harm. Metadata should acknowledge provenance and purpose and
        any limitations in secondary use inclusive of issues of
        consent.  
	
![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics10.png)

**The CARE principles were developed in relation to the FAIR principles
to add an ethical framework for open data**, as expressed in the phrase
#BeFAIRandCARE. Although they focus on Indigenous data, **they are
broadly relevant to other types of data, recognizing the rights of
different communities to control and access data by/for/about them**
(Carroll et al., 2021). Complementarity and disconnect between the
FAIR and CARE principles and Open Data Charter have been discussed by
participants in the open data community (Stone & Calderon 2019). While
FAIR and CARE are complementary, CARE has some overlap with the ODC as
well as a point of tension in relation to the ODC value of making data
“open by default” (Carroll et al. 2020). Stephanie Carroll and
colleagues suggest that the implementation of CARE can help clarify
and refine the intent of “open by default,” which could be defined in
a way that also upholds Indigenous data rights (Carroll et al. 2020).


**Mid-level frameworks:**

 * The First Nations Principles of [OCAP®](https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/) (ownership, control, access, possession). Developed by the First Nations Information Governance Centre, which has developed good educational materials explaining the principles and how to implement them, as well as a training course (available on their website; the class has a registration fee).    
 * [Inuit Circumpolar Council’s Ethical and Equitable Engagement Synthesis](https://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/project/icc-ethical-and-equitable-engagement-synthesis-report/). This synthesis summarizes the process and approach that ICC took to develop principles of ethical and equitable engagement for Inuit, which involved broad engagement and input from Inuit in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Chukotka. ICC is working on a full set of principles, which will be released after they have gone through review.  
 * [National Inuit Strategy on Research](https://www.itk.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ITK_NISR-Report_English_low_res.pdf). Developed by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the National Inuit Organization of Canada, with input from the Inuit regions of northern Canada. The research strategy discusses Indigenous data sovereignty.
 * In Alaska, the Alaska Native Knowledge Center developed [Guidelines for Respecting Cultural Knowledge](http://www.ankn.uaf.edu/publications/Knowledge.pdf). These include specific guidelines for authors and illustrators, curriculum developers and administrators, educators, editors and publishers, document reviewers, researchers, native language specialists, native community organizers, and the general public.
 * [Principles of Māori Data Sovereignty](https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/nga-rauemi) (Te Mana Rararunga) - Developed by the Maori Data Sovereignty Network (Maui Hudson is a founding member of this network).  
 * [Maiam nayri Wingara key principles](https://www.maiamnayriwingara.org/key-principles) developed by the Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective.    

**Foundational level frameworks:**

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics11.png)

* Tribal or community-level expectations/frameworks - such as [Native Village of Kotzebue’s Research Protocol](https://www.kotzebueira.org/wp-content/uploads/Native-Village-of-Kotzebue-Environmental-Program-February-2022-1-1.pdf) (Whiting 2022), which requests that researchers follow ethical research practices pertaining to informed consent and:

    + Inform the Tribe of plan to research and continue to inform them
       after permission has been granted;
    + Consult with the Tribe in project development, implementation and planning.
    + Explain the purposes, goals, time frame, and methodology of the
       research, including the sponsoring institutions and
       affiliations of the research project and identify the person in
       charge, as well as all investigators involved in the research,
       and the need for consultants, guides, or interpreters and
       proposed compensation rates for same  
    + Share results with the Tribe in non-technical language
    + Give credit to those contributing to the research project by
    acknowledging the Intellectual Property Rights of individual
    Tribal citizens taking part in the research (unless there are
    requirements for anonymity)
    + Recognize that all information belongs to the Tribe and
    divulgence of such information is expressly forbidden without
    permission of the Tribe;
    + Compensate Indigenous Knowledge holders fairly for sharing their knowledge.


### Discussion questions:

What do you see as the benefits to your research (or to Arctic
research more generally) from applying the frameworks discussed today?
What do you see as the major impediments to adopting these frameworks
in the context of open science? How might you navigate these conflicts
within your own research project(s)?
