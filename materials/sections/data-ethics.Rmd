## Open Data Ethics

Developed by the Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the
Arctic (ELOKA) and Navigating the New Arctic Community Office
(NNA-CO).

### Introduction

This part of the training offers an introduction to ethics in the
context of open science. It was developed with input from ELOKA and
the NNA-CO, and is a work-in-progress – this is the first time we are
offering this training. The training introduces ethics issues in a
broad way and includes discussion of social science data and open
science, but the majority of the section focuses on issues related to
research with, by, and for Indigenous communities. We recognize that
there is a need for more in-depth training and focus on open science
for social scientists and others who are not engaging with Indigenous
Knowledge holders and Indigenous communities, and hope to develop
further resources in this area in the future. Many of the data
stewardship practices that have been identified as good practices
through Indigenous Data Sovereignty framework development are also
relevant for those working with Arctic communities that are not
Indigenous, although the rights frameworks and collective ownership is
specific to the Indigenous context.

The examples we include in this training are primarily drawn from the
North American research context. In future trainings, we plan to
expand and include examples from other Indigenous Arctic contexts. We
welcome suggestions and resources that would strengthen this training
for audiences outside of North America.

We also recognize the importance of trainings on Indigenous data
sovereignty and ethics that are being developed and facilitated by
Indigenous organizations and facilitators. In this training we offer
some introductory material but there is much more depth offered in IDS
specific trainings. We include some suggestions of organizations
offering further training in the “resources” section and encourage
participants to seek out these opportunities to deepen their
understanding.
