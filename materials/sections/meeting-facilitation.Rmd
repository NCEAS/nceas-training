### Designing and facilitating effective meetings

As humans, we are constantly coming together in groups for some common purpose. At our core, we are social animals, and our exceptional abilities to connect and collaborate may be among the main things that distinguish us as a species. So if meetings are just opportunities for groups of humans to connect and collaborate, why do so many of us find them so painful? Probably we are going about this the wrong way!

Luckily there are simple things you can do to make your meetings more enjoyable and effective for everyone. They come down to thoughtful meeting design and effective facilitation. In general:

- Effective meetings have a clear purpose / goal. 
- The outcomes or outputs you want to walk away with have been clearly articulated.
- The right people have been convened.
- Those people understand the purpose and objectives of the meeting.
- They understand their role, and they are ready to engage in the way that will best serve the collective purpose. 
- The agenda for the meeting has been designed with the outcomes and outputs in mind.
- The format, facilities, and activities suit the agenda and purpose of the meeting.
- The format, facilities, and activities encourage and empower people to contribute fully and openly. Careful thought has been given to how their contributions will be harvested.
- People listen, participate, and take responsibility for leadership in ways that support other participants, the process, and progress.
- Actions and next steps are clearly described (including roles, responsibilities, timelines, definition of success) and taken up by participants.
- Progress (during and after the meeting) is reviewed, tracked, and communicated.
- Everyone is invited to review progress / success and feed learning back in to improve future meetings and ongoing work of the team. 


####  Designing for long term success

What are we trying to achieve when we design and facilitate a team science meeting?

First, we are working to build and sustain a [coalition of the willing](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-secret-sauce-for-environmental-problem-solving/) – a group of people united in shared purpose, willing to contribute. 

Second, we want to foster creativity. When faced with complex problems without obvious solutions, we need to invite new ideas from all quarters and create the conditions where innovation and unconventional thinking are welcomed. We cannot know ahead of time where good ideas will come from. 

Third, we want results, so we need to create a really productive environment. The key to that productivity is good communication. And, despite the fact that many academics have been trained to rely on critical debate to defend and refine their ideas, the style of communication that is most effective for interdisciplinary problem-solving is dialogue. Dialogue is covered in more depth below.

Finally, in most team science endeavors, we can and should also be designing for future collaborative potential. These people are part of your professional network and could become lifelong collaborators. How do you build and sustain a pool of collaborators who can become part of your future coalitions of the willing for new projects?

#### The value of planning

Good meeting design starts with understanding your purpose and objectives. Once you understand **why** you need to meet (your overarching goal) and **what** you want to accomplish (the specific outcomes you are driving toward), you can turn to how you will accomplish your purpose  (i.e. the agenda design) and **who** will play what roles.  A good rule of thumb is to allow 2-3x as much time to plan a meeting as its duration. 

![why, what, how, who](images/why-what-how-who.jpg)

If you are at the start of a collaborative project, your initial meeting(s) should seek to establish (1) refined questions, goals and objectives; (2) an engaged team with a clear sense of the overall vision and next steps; (3) a clear work plan with timelines, roles and responsibilities; and (4) a plan for communication and coordination of work between meetings (and ideally, the dates for your next meeting). 

Take a team approach to both planning and running meetings. 

#### Meeting facilitation

When it’s your turn to facilitate a meeting, give some thought to where facilitation will likely be needed. Where do you anticipate potential logjams or sticking points? Where have you seen the group get stuck in the past? Are there personalities or relationships in the group that may require mediation, e.g., individuals that tend to dominate conversation or take the group off course? How will you encourage connection and creativity with this particular group? Who can you count on to help you ensure the meeting runs smoothly?

#### Sharing the load of effective meeting facilitation

It’s very difficult to both facilitate a conversation and engage fully in it as a participant. If you add taking notes on top of that, it’s sure to become overwhelming. So recruit some help. You can share these and other roles among group members and rotate duties over time: 

- Meeting chair – keeps an eye on the overall vision and progress of the meeting
- Discussion leader(s) – each session
- Process facilitator – sets tone and pace, mediates conflicts, and ensures all voices are being heard, interpersonal dynamics are positive/effective, and group is staying on task
- Timekeeper – may also be the chair or facilitator
- Notetaker – captures action items and notes, often in a google doc that can be viewed and added to by others; this role should be rotated and shared evenly among genders and career stage; could also produce a meeting summary 
- Scribe – captures important points that can be seen in real time by the whole group, usually on a whiteboard or flipchart
- Spotter – keeps a running list of who is waiting to speak (especially in large groups or intense discussions)
- Relationship monitor – tracks group dynamics and actively works to help everyone feel included and engaged on personal and social levels
- Participation monitor – engineers opportunities for participation, quells interrupters, amplifies and credits the messages of quieter participants. 

As you get to know your team members, you can start to match people to these different roles based on their skills and recruit them to help. 

#### Dialogue as the container for collaboration

Team science benefits from the diverse perspectives and ideas of researchers coming together to generate novel ideas. The flow of new ideas is supported by rich, inclusive dialogue. In contrast to debate or discussion, dialogue allows groups to recognize the limits on their own and others’ individual perspectives and to strive for more coherent thought. Dialogue becomes a container for collective thinking and exploration – a process that can take teams in directions not imagined or planned. 

In *discussion*, different views are presented and defended, and this may provide a useful analysis of the whole situation. In *dialogue*, all views are treated as equally valid, and different views are presented as a means toward discovering a new view. Participants listen to understand one another, not to win. In a *skillful discussion*, decisions are made. In a *dialogue*, complex issues are explored and shared meaning is created. Both are critical to the collaborative process, and the more artfully a group can move between these two forms of discourse (and out of less productive *debate* and *polite discussion*) according to what is needed, the more effective the group will be.

Agreements or principles can help enable dialogue. (See list of potential agreements in the resources section). Challenge participants to speak to be understood, rather than to win a point, and listen for understanding, rather than for the weakness in another’s argument. Put a premium on defining terms, unpacking assumptions, and explaining thinking to bridge diverse disciplinary perspectives. Opportunities to build social cohesion and human connection also support dialogue. These could take the form of icebreakers or other exercises that invite people to connect on a personal level. Or they could be informal activities like coffee breaks, field trips, sports, or group dinners that offer opportunities for people to get to know each other and build connections.

#### Techniques for democratizing participation

Remember that your goal is to enable the full participation of all group members so you can tap their diverse perspectives and catalyze creative problem-solving. To do this, you want to thoughtfully work to democratize participation so that a few voices don’t dominate discussion. 

A few simple techniques can help:
 
- For in person meetings, ask people to stand a tent card on end or raise their hand to indicate when they want to speak. Have someone track the order they go up and call on people in order. For virtual meetings, you can have people raise their hand or put their name in the chat to indicate they want to speak
- Regularly invite, amplify and credit the contributions of quieter participants and those who may have less power in the group 
- Allow time for silent reflection before inviting discussion. Pose a specific question or prompt
- Mix up the discussion format throughout the meeting - pairs, small groups, plenary
- Provide opportunities for small groups to go off and work and then report refined ideas back to the group

Some facilitators will offer tips for dealing with “difficult” personalities or communication styles, but how difficult someone else appears is in the eye (or ears) of the beholder and will depend on the situation. Be aware of your own biases toward or against particular communication styles. Attend to the dynamics of the group and intervene when needed to make sure the team’s energy is directed toward meeting its goals. And use the tips and tools offered above, and the models described below, to democratize participation and help all participants to be as constructive as possible.

#### The Four Player Model
A useful tool for reading the dynamics of the room comes from David Kantor, a family psychologist who has studied interpersonal communication for many years. Kantor analyzed the speech acts (statements or questions) in thousands of conversations among family members and other groups. He concluded that in any conversation, there are four primary speech acts that people will make: Move, Follow, Oppose, or Bystand.

When someone **moves**, they are taking the lead, making a suggestion, proposal or positing an idea. If someone chooses to **follow**, they affirm or agree with that idea. Someone else may choose to **oppose** the idea by offering criticism or counter-evidence or withholding support. Others may **bystand** by neither following nor opposing, but instead adding information that comes from a different point of view. 

<img style="float: left;width: 150px;" src="images/ideas_form_Nancy_Margulies_World_Cafe.jpg"/>

As the conversation unfolds, other moves will be made, and the participants may play different roles, though most of us feel more comfortable with some types of speech acts than others. All four types are valuable and necessary for moving a group forward. Conversations that don’t involve a balance of all four can indicate a counterproductive group dynamic.

As a facilitator, speech act patterns can yield insights into group dynamics and help you figure out your next move. Start listening. A group that is caught in a pattern of counterpoint – of move-oppose-move-oppose – may be trapped in debate or power struggle. As the facilitator, try asking a question that would invite a follow, such as “Who’s onboard with this idea?” or “Is there any part of what you’ve heard that you can agree with?” Or invite a bystand: “What do you notice about what’s happening in the room right now?” In a different group you may observe that an initial move is followed by a string of bystand comments or questions. For a complex issue this may be appropriate, but the group may be getting caught in “analysis-paralysis.” It might be time to invite either a follow (“Can you support this?”) or an oppose (“What could go wrong?”).

#### The Groan Zone (aka the Diamond Participation Model)

As researchers and practitioners engaged in transdisciplinary problem-solving, we know the value of diverse perspectives. We also know how common it is for groups to run into challenges when trying to learn from diverse ideas and come to consensus on creative solutions.

This challenging, often uncomfortable space, is called the groan zone. The term comes from Sam Kaner’s diamond model of participation shown in the figure below. After an initial period of divergent thinking, where diverse ideas are introduced, groups have to organize that information, focus on what’s most important, and make decisions in order to move forward into the phase of convergent thinking.

Navigating that transition between divergent and convergent thinking is the realm in which creativity and innovation emerge, if we let them.  Groups that avoid the groan zone and converge too early may settle for status quo solutions. Other groups never make it out of the groan zone and fail to converge on a solution.

![](images/groan_zone.jpg)

Inviting diverse perspectives (divergence), synthesizing to yield new breakthroughs (emergence), and coalescing around a shared vision for how to move forward (convergence) are fundamental elements of successful collaboration, and they don’t just happen once. In fact, a well-designed collaboration will move through these stages over and over again.

In the arc of a project, a group may encounter the groan zone at multiple scales – within an individual discussion, midway through a multi-day meeting, part way through a multi-year project, or all of the above. Group participants often report that their satisfaction ebbs in the messy middle of their project, but rises again as the project approaches the end.

Don’t Panic: Half the battle is recognizing that you are entering the groan zone. Just naming the transition from divergence to convergence as a distinct, valuable, and normal phase can help to reassure a group. Recognizing that the groan zone is inevitable, our best option is to embrace it and let it spark opportunities for the emergence of novel ideas. The right tools (discussed below) can support that.

#### Tools to support divergent and emergent thinking
	
Be creative and empathetic when you design your agenda. Think about your participants and what is going to help all of them participate fully and creatively. Here are a few techniques and microstructures we have found useful in the divergent and emergent stages of a process.

#### Making thinking visible 

Remember that there are many different ways that people learn. Encourage group members to synthesize and feed back the information that is being discussed in different ways to enhance understanding and learning. Visual tools - including written notes and graphics or drawings - can be a helpful complement to oral discussion. 

![](images/visible_thinking_Nancy_Margulies_World_Cafe.jpg)

Consider using:
- Shared notes, e.g. in google docs
- Scribing on a flipchart or whiteboard 
- Grids to organize information and compare 
- Conceptual models to articulate shared understanding of complex systems
- Manifestos, abstracts and other written collateral to distill ideas

When capturing notes, try to use people’s own words; if necessary ask them to distill long or complex points into a headline you can capture. Invite them to offer corrections if you didn’t capture what they meant.


#### Techniques to support convergent thinking (i.e., getting to agreement)

Coming to a clear decision can sometimes be the hardest work of a collaboration. Use tools and frameworks to help your group converge in its thinking. 

- **Clarify your decisionmaking process up front**. Are you trying to reach full consensus within this group or does majority rule? Or is this a decision that will be made by an individual or small group, based on the larger group’s input? If you are seeking consensus but can’t reach it, what’s your fallback plan? Clarifying how you will make decisions can help you avoid one of the worst pitfalls of collaboration - never making them.
- **Co-create conceptual frameworks** to organize ideas and draw connections. Constructing a visual model together helps to reveal the different ways individuals think about the problem, which can build a shared understanding of it and unlock new ways of addressing it. Joint model building supports metacognition, raising awareness of individual assumptions, gaps, and biases.
- **Make specific proposals**. Get the ideas on paper. Give each idea a headline and write a short abstract that distills the problem, why it’s important, and your proposed solution. Review each other’s ideas. Identify areas of confusion or uncertainty. Clarify language.
- **Specify your criteria for convergence**. A simple two-axis plot can help a group decide how to focus its effort. For example, as shown in the figure below, you might assess each idea for its feasibility and potential impact, and then focus on those scoring high in both. Defining what you mean by feasibility and impact before your start scoring is essential and can be another source of collaborative learning.

- **Assess support for proposals**, e.g. by using a gradient of agreement
