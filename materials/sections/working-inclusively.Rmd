### Module on diversity

- Current lack of material from an explicit individual perspective
- Lots of general resources we can use as a starting point
- Ben attended session on individual nature of diversity, which recommended:
    - Form a personal board (peer support, mentor and sponsor)
    - Set goals on 1, 2, 5yr goal scale to address diversity in your own practices.
    - Sponsor someone else to be a mentor.
