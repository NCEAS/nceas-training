## Working in an Inclusive Manner

We hope NEON postdocs will join us in making a lifelong commitment to helping foster justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI) in science and research, and to helping create and provide a safe, productive, and welcoming workplace environment for all people. JEDI issues in science touch all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity and background. It is therefore important for each individual to consider their roles and relationships with respect to these issues, and to consider to be a part of an inclusive and just culture of science and research. 

Navigating a career path in science and research can be very challenging for individuals, especially when this is done alone, without a strong support network, and/or as someone from an underrepresented group. We thus recommend that you implement a few simple strategies that can help overcome both normal and extraordinary obstacles that you may encounter as you continue along this path:

- *Consider* ways to [recognize](https://serc.carleton.edu/advancegeo/resources/bias.html) bias (including personal bias) in science and the workplace
- *Enroll* in JEDI trainings or workshops (e.g., [one provided by ADVANCE GEO](https://serc.carleton.edu/advancegeo/workshops/index.html)) to gain skills and perspectives that are widely relevant to any career path 
- *Review collections of resources* about JEDI in academic research (e.g., resources compiled by LTER and NCEAS), with a view towards actions that individuals and their extended communities can take to develop the strengths, skills, and relationships necessary to create fully inclusive learning and work environments. Categories of information in the [LTER](https://lternet.edu/network-organization/diversity-resources/) and [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/diversity-inclusion) collections that may be especially relevant to NEON postdocs may include:
    - LTER
        - Understanding the problem in academia and ecology
        - Creating an inclusive environment
        - Mentoring
        - Having difficult conversations
        - Recruiting
        - Funding
        - Building community
        - Evidence that diversity improves problem solving and creativity
    - NCEAS (*“Other General Resources”* menu option)
        - Diversity & inclusion
        - Anti-racism resources
        - Gender equity
        - Resources for parents
- *Ask* your advisor and/or your institution about its Code of Conduct for the workspace, including related to meetings, conferences, socializing, and more (e.g., see NCEAS’ [Code of Conduct](https://live-ncea-ucsb-edu-v01.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/2020-02/NCEAS_Code-of-Conduct_2019.pdf) for its working group meetings). If one is not yet in place, request it to be produced (or co-produced with your input). 
- *Set [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) professional goals for yourself* on 1, 2, and 5 year timescales, and be sure these goals address how justice, equity, diversity and inclusion can and will manifest through your work.
- *Form a [personal board](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2020/03/personal-board-directors-can-help-you-navigate-challenges-your-career)* including at least 3-4 people in your life who you trust and admire, who can provide diverse perspectives and experiences that can enlighten you, and who have demonstrated that they’re willing to provide advice when you need it. This board will prove valuable in many ways, including that you can seek their guidance and feedback related to JEDI issues. 
- *Find new ways to offer support and mentorship opportunities to others*, including any colleagues who may not yet have a strong network of professional supporters and advisors. In addition to ‘paying it forward,’ practicing mentorship will help you develop leadership skills.
