## Open Data Ethics

Developed in collaboration with the [Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the
Arctic (ELOKA)](https://eloka-arctic.org/) and [Navigating the New Arctic Community Office
(NNA-CO)](https://nna-co.org/).

### Learning Objectives

In this lesson, we will:

- Discuss Indigenous Data Sovereignty in the context of open science
- Discuss FAIR and CARE Principles 
- Review concepts such as co-production of knowledge and Indigenous data governance 
- Examine case studies of relationships between Arctic Indigenous communities and natural science researchers

### Introduction

This part of the course offers an introduction to ethics in the
context of open science. It was developed with input from ELOKA and
the NNA-CO, and is a work-in-progress – this is the first time we are
offering this training. The training introduces ethics issues in a
broad way and includes discussion of social science data and open
science, but the majority of the section focuses on issues related to
research with, by, and for Indigenous communities. We recognize that
there is a need for more in-depth training and focus on open science
for social scientists and others who are not engaging with Indigenous
Knowledge holders and Indigenous communities, and hope to develop
further resources in this area in the future. **Many of the data
stewardship practices that have been identified as good practices
through Indigenous Data Sovereignty framework development are also
relevant for those working with Arctic communities that are not
Indigenous, although the rights frameworks and collective ownership is
specific to the Indigenous context.**

The examples we include in this training are primarily drawn from the
North American research context. In future trainings, we plan to
expand and include examples from other Indigenous Arctic contexts. **We
welcome suggestions and resources that would strengthen this training
for audiences outside of North America.**  

We also recognize the importance of trainings on Indigenous data
sovereignty and ethics that are being developed and facilitated by
Indigenous organizations and facilitators. In this training we offer
some introductory material but there is much more depth offered in IDS
specific trainings. We include some suggestions of organizations
offering further training in the “resources” section and encourage
participants to seek out these opportunities to deepen their
understanding.  And there are several sessions this week with some of
the authors of the frameworks and protocols that will be discussed,
including:

### Ethical Data Considerations in Your Research
As the primary repository for the Arctic section of the National Science Foundation, the Arctic Data Center accepts Arctic data from all disciplines. Recently, a new submission feature was released which asks researchers to describe the ethical considerations that are apparent in their research. This question is asked to all researchers, regardless of disciplines. 

#### Discussion Questions

### FAIR and Open Science
To recap, the Arctic Data Center is an openly-accessible data repository and the data published through the repository is open for anyone to reuse, subject to conditions of the license (at the Arctic Data Center, data is released under one of two licenses: CC-0 Public Domain and CC-By Attribution 4.0). In facilitating use of data resources, the data stewardship community have converged on principles surrounding best practices for open data management One set of these principles is the FAIR principles. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible.

The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) principles for data management are widely known and broadly endorsed.

FAIR Principles and open science are not synonymous, however they often go hand in hand. However, data can be open and not FAIR, and vice verse. 

The “Fostering FAIR Data Practices in Europe” project found that it is more monetarily and timely expensive when FAIR principles are not used, and it was estimated that 10.2 billion dollars per years are spent through “storage and license costs to more qualitative costs related to the time spent by researchers on creation, collection and management of data, and the risks of research duplication.” FAIR principles and open science are overlapping concepts, but are distinctive concepts. Open science supports a culture of sharing research outputs and data, and FAIR focuses on how to prepare the data. The FAIR principles place emphasis on machine readability, “distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar” (Wilkinson et al 2016) and as such, do not fully engage with sensitive data considerations and with  Indigenous rights and interests (Research Data Alliance International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group, 2019).


### Equity issues in open science

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics01.png)
With an Indigenous population double that of Indigenous peoples across the globe, there are over 40 different ethnic and cultural groups in the Arctic (Arctic Council, 2021). Arctic communities (defined as a place and the people who live there,
based on geographic location in the Arctic/sub-Arctic) are involved in
research in diverse ways - as hosts to visiting or non-local
researchers, as well as “home” to community researchers who are
leading or collaborating on research projects. Over the past decades,
community voices of discontent with standard research practices that
are often exclusive and perpetuate inequities have grown stronger. The
Arctic research community (defined more broadly as the range of
institutions, organizations, researchers and local communities
involved in research) is in the midst of a complex conversation about
equity in research aimed at transforming research practice to make it
more equitable and inclusive.

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics02.png)

**One of the drivers of community concerns is the colonial practice of
extracting knowledge from a place or group of people without respect
for local norms of relationship with people and place, and without an
ethical commitment to sharing and making benefits of knowledge
accessible and accountable to that place.** Extractive research can be defined as research that is not mutually beneficial, and the results primarily benefit the researcher. Such approaches to knowledge
and data extraction follow hundreds of years of exploration and
research that viewed science as a tool of “Enlightenment” yet focused
exclusively on benefits to White, European (or “southern” from an
Arctic community perspective) researchers and scientists. This
prioritization of non-local perspectives and needs (to Arctic
communities) continues in Arctic research.

**One result of this approach to research has been a lack of access for
Arctic residents to the data and knowledge that have resulted from
research conducted in their own communities.** Much of this data was
stored in the personal files or hard drives of researchers, or in
archives located in urban centers far from the Arctic.

To address issues like these, the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) introduced CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance to support Indigenous data sovereignty. CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance stand for Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics. The CARE principles for Indigenous Data Governance complement the more data-centric approach of the FAIR principles, introducing social responsibility to open data management practices. These principles ask researchers to put human well-being at the forefront of open-science and data sharing (Carroll et al., 2021; Research Data Alliance International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group, September 2019). Indigenous data sovereignty and considerations related to working with Indigenous communities are particularly relevant to the Arctic. The CARE Principles stand for:

* Collective Benefit - Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data
* Authority to Control - Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognized and their authority to control such data be empowered. Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous lands, territories, resources, knowledges and geographical indicators, are represented and identified within data.
* Responsibility - Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit. Accountability requires meaningful and openly available evidence of these efforts and the benefits accruing to Indigenous Peoples.
* Ethics - Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.


To many, the FAIR and CARE principles are viewed by many as complementary: CARE aligns with FAIR by outlining guidelines for publishing data that contributes to open-science and at the same time, accounts for Indigenous’ Peoples rights and interests.

Sharing sensitive data introduces unique ethical considerations, and FAIR and CARE principles speak to this by recommending sharing anonymized metadata to encourage discover ability and reduce duplicate research efforts, following consent of rights holders  (Puebla & Lowenberg, 2021). While initially designed to support Indigenous data sovereignty, CARE principles are being adopted more broadly and researchers argue they are relevant across all disciplines (Carroll et al., 2021). As such, these principles introduce a “game changing perspective” for all researchers that encourages transparency in data ethics, and encourages data reuse that is both purposeful and intentional and that aligns with human well-being (Carroll et al., 2021). Hence, to enable the research community to articulate and document the degree of data sensitivity, and ethical research practices, the Arctic Data Center has introduced new submission requirements.

From ELOKA and NNA: Open science is ostensibly about making access to data and knowledge
more equitable and open and enabling reproducible research. These are laudable goals and on the surface, could provide a counterbalance to
traditional approaches that limited Arctic community members’ access
to research data and knowledge. Because it is being implemented within
a social and institutional context that continues to perpetuate
inequities in research, however, there are significant challenges
remaining to ethically and equitably implementing open science
practices.

Here are some examples of impediments to ethical and equitable
implementation of open science:  

* Many Open Science tools and practices (e.g. GitHub, non-proprietary
  software) have been adopted from software development, and are not
  familiar to many, even physical, scientists. This makes barriers to
  implementation of open science and participation in open science
  practices higher for some than for others.  

* Some of the main focus areas of open science (making sure data is
  archived in a clean and reusable format, open access publication)
  are still not accessible for Arctic residents and others who are not
  already situated within an academic environment. Open science
  assumes access to tools and infrastructure, such as computers that
  have reliable and low-cost or subsidized internet access.  

* These structural inequalities extend even within the
  academy. Researchers and academics based in lower-income countries
  have fewer provided resources and sources of support to pay for open
  access fees and [face greater challenges in adopting open science
  practices](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00724-0?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20220317&utm_source=nature_etoc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20220317&sap-outbound-id=B4EAD742973291804C3AEF5A15DD13806C9F2C30).

* The emphasis of open science on stakeholder and rights holder
  engagement and knowledge co-production also creates unintended
  challenges for Arctic communities. For example, when the National
  Science Foundation’s Navigating the New Arctic initiative, which
  brought millions of additional funds to Arctic research, suggested
  that research projects incorporate co-production and collaboration
  with Arctic communities, community representatives reported being
  inundated with requests from researchers. Perhaps because NNA was
  designed, in part, to bring new researchers and disciplines into
  Arctic research, many of these requests were made without adequate
  regard for recognized good practices for community engagement (such
  as the importance of building relationships, reaching out very early
  for input; communicating “early and often;” and incorporating
  significant resources for community participants’ time and knowledge
  into project budgets, among other things). As a [letter to NSF](https://kawerak.org/download/navigating-the-new-arctic-program-comment-letter/)
  written by Kawerak, the Association of Village Council Presidents,
  the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island, and the Bering Sea Elders
  Group emphasized, without adequate attention to these practices as
  well as an emphasis on topics that communities have identified as
  important, research will not serve community partners and will fail
  to achieve its broader impact goals. (See also the [2021 update
  letter](https://kawerak.org/download/dec-2021-nna-follow-up-letter/) from the same organizations).  





### Co-production of knowledge
Here, we define co-production of knowledge as the contribution of various knowledge sources, and capacity sharing from different rights holders and stakeholders in the context of co-creating knowledge and information to inform research projects and environmental decision-making (Lemos & Morehouse, 2005). Many argue that co-production of knowledge will increase the usability and relevance of science for society (Lemos & Morehouse, 2005; Meadow et al., 2015; Wall et al., 2017). Based on a literature review from Djenontin & Meadow (2018) of successful examples of co-production, here are several themes of successful co-production.

** Development, design and implementation components **

Rights holders and stakeholders' needs should drive the project. Several approaches to help ensure this include:
* co-defining research questions
* co-conceptualizing and co-designing the research project 
* co-leadership 

In the current research framework that involves timely deadlines for finishing and producing research, there are many challenges that include time and resources. Many of these challenges stem from research that is still founded on a western timeline. Navigating these challenges is a work in progress, however the foundation starts at building long-term relationships. 


### Indigenous data governance and sovereignty

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics08.png)

**All governing entities, whether national, state, local, or tribal,
need access to good, current, relevant data in order to make policy,
planning, and programmatic decisions.** Indigenous nations and
organizations have had to push for data about their peoples and
communities to be collected and shared in ethical and culturally
appropriate ways, and they have also had to fight for resources and
capacity to develop and lead their own research programs.

#### Indigenous data definitions:

**Indigenous data sovereignty** “...refers to the right of Indigenous
peoples to govern the collection, ownership, and application of data
about Indigenous communities, peoples, lands, and resources (Rainie et
al. 2019). These governance rights apply “regardless of where/by whom
data is held (Rainie et al. 2019).

Some Indigenous individuals and communities have expressed
dissatisfaction with the term “data” as being too narrowly focused and
abstract to represent the embedded and holistic nature of knowledge in
Indigenous communities. **Knowledge sovereignty** is a related term that
has a similar meaning but is framed more broadly, and has been defined
as:

“Tribal communities having control over the documentation and
production of knowledge (such as through research activities) which
relate to Alaska Native people and the resources they steward and
depend on” (Kawerak 2021).

**Indigenous data** is “data in a wide variety of formats inclusive of
digital data and data as knowledge and information. It encompasses
data, information, and knowledge about Indigenous individuals,
collectives, entities, lifeways, cultures, lands, and resources.”
(Rainie et al. 2019)

**Indigenous data governance** is “The entitlement to determine how
Indigenous data is governed and stewarded” (Rainie et al. 2019)





## Discussion questions:

1. What do you see as the benefits to your research (or to Arctic
research more generally) from applying the frameworks discussed today?
What do you see as the major impediments to adopting these frameworks
in the context of open science? How might you navigate these conflicts
within your own research project(s)?
1. How do you and/or your research lab view open science?
