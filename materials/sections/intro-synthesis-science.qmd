## What is Synthesis Science?

### Synthesis Science in Ecology

*Synthesis science is the process of distilling existing data, ideas, theories, or methods drawn from many sources, across multiple fields of inquiry, to accelerate the generation of new scientific knowledge, often at a broad scale.*
:::

To break that down further, think of it this way: synthesis science utilizes **existing** data and knowledge to generate new inights. It's like putting together puzzle pieces from different sources to create a bigger picture.

Synthesis science is fundamentally different than other types of academic research in that it does not involve collecting new or original data to conduct research or to answer a research question.

Since the ecological and environmental sciences are complex and often interdisciplinary, synthesis approaches are ideal for "understanding complexity across scales, leveraging data from various disciplines, facilitating discovery of general patterns in natural systems, and informing policy" [@halpern2023] in the ecological and environmental sciences.

### The Value and Impact of Synthesis Research

![Graphic adapted from Engingeering Ideas newsletter on Substack](images/intro-to-synthesis-1.png)

Data is everywhere and information is more accessible than ever, but how can we leverage both data and knowledge to further our understanding of a topic and turn those insights into meaningful action? This is where synthesis research shines.

There are many studies that **value the importance of synthesis** for varying reasons including:

-   Elevating scientific research as evidence that is influential in policy-making [@dicks2014]
-   Addressing the challenge of "information overload" [@hampton2011]
-   Delivering research products that enhance scientific knowledge in decision-making [@hampton2011]
-   Providing critical knowledge to solve environmental issues [@carpenter2009]
-   Initiating new collaborations and new insights across disciplines and non-academic sectors [@hampton2011]

As synthesis science and research synthesis approaches have been gaining prominenance in the ecological and environmental fields, researchers have sought to understand the **impacts of synthesis**. In particular, @wyborn2018 identified the following impacts of research synthesis:

-   Knowledge is used to change understanding of a system or phenomena
-   Knowledge changes understanding of the interconnections between actors, sectors or systems
-   Knowledge is used to support a particular view of a problem
-   Knowledge is used as the prime source of information to inform policy change or reform
-   Knowledge use is dependent on the capacity to understand or apply knowledge in a given context

## Research Synthesis Approaches

In general, research synthesis approaches include utilizing existing research on a particular topic with the intention of integrating all the finding together.

There are multiple different types of approaches such as narrative reviews, vote counting (this quantitative method has been discredited, but you may find examples of it in your research), case studies, and more. However, **systematic reviews and meta-analysis are considered by some to be the "gold standard" of research synthesis** and are often used at NCEAS, which is why we're highlighting them here.

### What about data?

Data is essential to synthesis in ecological and environmental research. Synthesizing data can involve combining and analyzing data from multiple sources to address research questions, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions. This process might involve integrating data from field studies, experiments, observations, and other sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of ecological and environmental phenomena.

## Future of Synthesis

In February 2021, NCEAS hosted a virtual workshop where 127 ecologists, environmental and natural scientists convened to discuss the future priorities of synthesis science. Participants across career stages, institutions, backgrounds, and geographies were in attendance.

Participants proposed ideas or questions in pre-workshop brainstorming sessions; added and upvoted questions online; and worked in breakout teams during the workshop to refine upvoted questions into lists of top three questions. These final lists were then grouped into themes by the 12-person steering committee and discussed at length by the workshop participants.

In January 2023, over dozens of scientists authored and published [Priorities for synthesis research in ecology and environmental science](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.4342#ecs24342-bib-0004) the results of the workshop.

Seven priority research topics emerged: (1) diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ), (2) human and natural systems, (3) actionable and use-inspired science, (4) scale, (5) generality, (6) complexity and resilience, and (7) predictability. Additionally, two issues regarding the general practice of synthesis emerged: the need for increased participant diversity and inclusive research practices; and increased and improved data flow, access, and skill-building.

## Best Practices?

In synthesis research, it is also vital to consider and increase diversity of participants and to foster inclusive research environments. When diveristy and inclusion is not prioritized, syntheses risk being biased and less broadly applicable, which may lead to unjust and inequitable outcomes. Although the principles of diversity and inclusion are relevant to any scientific endeavor, they are particularly salient for synthesis given its integrative nature.
