## Slack

Slack is an instant messaging tool that connects people with the information they need. At NCEAS, we are big fans of Slack. It eases communication within a team, avoiding back-and-forth emailing. It is a much more straightforward way of communicating with each other, making it easier to collaborate.

You all should be part of the NCEAS Slack space (or at least have been invited to join). And all of you, plus all the instructors, are all part of the #delta-synthesis channel.

This is a discussion channel where you can contact instructors and colleagues with questions and share information relevant to the Delta Science Program / NCEAS data training and synthesis collaboration. During our first week of training, we will create independent channels for each synthesis group to facilitate communication within teams.
