### Survey instruments and methods

Surveys and questionnaires are commonly used research methods within social science and other fields. For example, understanding regional and national population demographics, income, and education as part of the [National Census](https://www.census.gov/en.html) activity, assessing audience perspectives on specific topics of research interest (e.g. the work by Tenopir and colleagues on [Data Sharing by Scientists](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021101)), evaluation of learning deliverable and outcomes, and consumer feedback on new and upcoming products. These are distinct from the use of the term survey within natural sciences, which might include geographical surveys ("the making of measurement in the field from which maps are drawn"), ecological surveys ("the process whereby a proposed development site is assess to establish any environmental impact the development may have") or biodiversity surveys ("provide detailed information about biodiversity and community structure") among others. In social science, a survey can be defined as:

a research method involving the use of standardised questionnaires or interviews to collect data about people and their preferences, thoughts, and behaviours in a systematic manner.
