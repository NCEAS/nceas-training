<!-- ## The Big Idea-->

## Introduction

Data management is the process of handling, organizing, documenting, and preserving data used in a research project. This is particularly important in synthesis science given the nature of synthesis, which involves combining data and information from multiple sources to answer broader questions, generate knowledge and provide insights into a particular problem or phenomenon.

## Benefits of managing your data

Successfully managing your data throughout a research project helps ensures its preservation for future use. It also facilitates collaboration within your team, and it helps advance your scientific outcomes.

**From a researcher perspective**

-   Keep yourself organized -- be able to find your files (data inputs, analytic scripts, outputs at various stages of the analytic process, etc.)
-   Track your science processes for reproducibility -- be able to match up your outputs with exact inputs and transformations that produced them
-   Better control versions of data -- easily identify versions that can be periodically purged
-   Quality control your data more efficiently
-   To avoid data loss (e.g. making backups)
-   Format your data for re-use (by yourself or others)
-   Be prepared to document your data for your own recollection, accountability, and re-use (by yourself or others)
-   Gain credibility and recognition for your science efforts through data sharing!

**Advancement of science**

-   Data is a valuable asset -- it is expensive and time consuming to collect

-   Maximize the effective use and value of data and information assets

-   Continually improve the quality including: data accuracy, integrity, integration, timeliness of data capture and presentation, relevance, and usefulness

-   Ensure appropriate use of data and information

-   Facilitate data sharing

-   Ensure sustainability and accessibility in long term for re-use in science

## The Data Life Cycle

The Data Life Cycle gives you an overview of meaningful steps in a research project. This step-by-step breakdown facilitates successful management and preservation of data throughout a project. Some research activities might use only part of the life cycle. For example, a meta-analysis might focus on the Discover, Integrate, and Analyze steps, while a project focused on primary data collection and analysis might bypass the Discover and Integrate steps.

The first step to working with data is identifying what is the Data Life Cycle is for my project. Using the data life cycle stages, create your own cycle that best fits your project needs.

| Step | Description|
|------|------------|
| *Plan*    | Map out the processes and resources for the entire data life cycle. Start with the project goals (desired outputs, outcomes, and impacts) and work backwards to build a data management plan, supporting data policies, and sustainability plans. |
| *Collect* | Observations are made either by hand or with sensors or other instruments, and the data are placed into digital form. You can structure the process of collecting data upfront to better implement data management.| 
| *Assure*  | Employ quality assurance and quality control procedures that enhance the quality of data (e.g., training participants, routine instrument calibration) and identify potential errors and techniques to address them. |
|*Describe* | Document data by describing the why, who, what, when, where, and how of the data. Metadata, or data about data, is key to data sharing and reuse, and many tools, such as standards and software, are available to help describe data.| 
| *Preserve* | Plan to preserve data in the short term to minimize potential losses (e.g., via accidents), and in the long term so that project stakeholders and others can access, interpret, and use the data in the future. Decide what data to preserve, where to preserve it, and what documentation needs to accompany the data. |
|*Discover*| Identify complementary data sets that can add value to project data. Strategies to help endure the data have a maximum impact include registering the project on a project directory site, depositing data in an open repository, and adding data descriptions to metadata clearing houses.|
|*Integrate*| Data from multiple sources are combined into a form that can be readily analyzed. For example, you could combine citizen science project data with other sources of data to enable new analyses and investigations. Successful data integration depends on documentation of the integration process, clearly citing and making accessible the data you are using, and employing good data management practices throughout the Data Life Cycle.| 
|*Analyze*| Create analyses and visualizations to identify patterns, test hypotheses, and illustrate findings. During this process, record your methods, document data processing steps, and ensure your data are reproducible. Learn about these best practices and more. |

### Planning is a key step

As you can see there is a lot happening around the Data Life Cycle. No matter how your data life cycle looks like, *Plan* will always be at the top of the cycle. It is advisable to initiate your data management planning at the beginning of your research process before any data has been collected or discovered.

In order to better plan and keep track of all the moving pieces when working with data, a good place to start is creating a Data Management Plan. However, this is not only the starting point. This is a “living” document that should be consulted and updated throughout the project.


A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document that describes how you will use your data during a research project, as well as what you will do with your data long after the project ends. DMPs are living documents and should be updated as research plans change to ensure new data management practices are captured ([Environmental Data Initiative](https://edirepository.org/resources/data-management-planning)).

A well-thought-out plan means you are more likely to:

-   stay organized
-   work efficiently
-   truly share data
-   engage your team
-   meet funder requirements as DMPs are becoming common in the submission process for proposals

A DMP is both a straightforward blueprint for how you manage your data, *and* provides guidelines for your and your team on policies, access, roles, and more. While it is important to plan, it is equally important to recognize that no plan is perfect, as change is inevitable. To make your DMP as robust as possible review it periodically with your team and adjust as the needs of the project change.


### How to Plan

-   **Plan early:** research shows that over time, information is lost and this is inevitable so it's important to think about long-term plans for your research at the beginning before you're deep in your project. And ultimately, you'll save more time.
-   **Plan in collaboration:** high engagement of your team and other important contributors is not only a benefit to your project, but it also makes your DMP more resilient. When you include diverse expertise and perspectives to the planning stages, you're more likely to overcome obstacles in the future.
-   **Utilize existing resources:** don't reinvent the wheel! There are many great DMP resources out there. Consider the article *Ten Simple Rules for Creating a Good Data Management Plan* [@michener2015], which has succinct guidelines on what to include in a DMP. Or use an online tool like [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/), which provides official DMP templates from funders like NSF, example answers, and allows for collaboration. Note USGS has several templates available within DMPTool.
-   **Make revising part of the process:** Don't let your DMP collect dust after your initially write it. Make revising the DMP part of your research project and use it as a guide to ensure you're keeping on track.
-   **Include tidy and ethical lens:** It is important to start thinking through these lenses during the planning process of your DMP, it will make it easier to include and maintain tidy and ethical principles throughout the entire project. Find information about these topics in the following links to NCEAS Learning Hub materials for a previous course:
        -       [Tidy data](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-06-delta/session_09.html), and our content on 
        -       [FAIR principle](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-06-delta/session_16.html#what-is-fair)

## Metadata Best Practices

Within the data life cycle you can be collecting data (creating new data) or integrating data that has all ready been collected. Either way, **metadata** plays plays a major role to successfully spin around the cycle because it enables data reuse long after the original collection.

Imagine that you're writing your metadata for a typical researcher (who might even be you!) 30+ years from now - what will they need to understand what's inside your data files?

The goal is to have enough information for the researcher to **understand the data**, **interpret the data**, and then **reuse the data** in another study.

### Overall Guidelines

Another way to think about metadata is to answer the following questions with the documentation:

-   What was measured?
-   Who measured it?
-   When was it measured?
-   Where was it measured?
-   How was it measured?
-   How is the data structured?
-   Why was the data collected?
-   Who should get credit for this data (researcher AND funding agency)?
-   How can this data be reused (licensing)?

### Bibliographic Guidelines

The details that will help your data be cited correctly are:

-   **Global identifier** like a digital object identifier (DOI)
-   Descriptive **title** that includes information about the topic, the geographic location, the dates, and if applicable, the scale of the data
-   Descriptive **abstract** that serves as a brief overview off the specific contents and purpose of the data package
-   **Funding information** like the award number and the sponsor
-   **People and organizations** like the creator of the dataset (i.e. who should be cited), the person to **contact** about the dataset (if different than the creator), and the contributors to the dataset

### Discovery Guidelines

The details that will help your data be discovered correctly are:

-   **Geospatial coverage** of the data, including the field and laboratory sampling locations, place names and precise coordinates
-   **Temporal coverage** of the data, including when the measurements were made and what time period (ie the calendar time or the geologic time) the measurements apply to
-   **Taxonomic coverage** of the data, including what species were measured and what taxonomy standards and procedures were followed
-   Any other **contextual information** as needed

### Interpretation Guidelines

The details that will help your data be interpreted correctly are:

-   **Collection methods** for both field and laboratory data the full experimental and project design as well as how the data in the dataset fits into the overall project
-   **Processing methods** for both field and laboratory samples
-   All sample **quality control procedures**
-   **Provenance** information to support your analysis and modelling methods
-   Information about the **hardware and software** used to process your data, including the make, model, and version
-   **Computing quality control** procedures like testing or code review

### Data Structure and Contents

-   **Everything needs a description**: the data model, the data objects (like tables, images, matrices, spatial layers, etc), and the variables all need to be described so that there is no room for misinterpretation.
-   **Variable information** includes the definition of a variable, a standardized unit of measurement, definitions of any coded values (i.e. 0 = not collected), and any missing values (i.e. 999 = NA).

Not only is this information helpful to you and any other researcher in the future using your data, but it is also helpful to search engines. The semantics of your dataset are crucial to ensure your data is both discoverable by others and interoperable (that is, reusable).

For example, if you were to search for the character string "carbon dioxide flux" in a data repository, not all relevant results will be shown due to varying vocabulary conventions (i.e., "CO2 flux" instead of "carbon dioxide flux") across disciplines --- only datasets containing the exact words "carbon dioxide flux" are returned. With correct semantic annotation of the variables, your dataset that includes information about carbon dioxide flux but that calls it CO2 flux WOULD be included in that search.

### Rights and Attribution

Correctly **assigning a way for your datasets to be cited** and reused is the last piece of a complete metadata document. This section sets the scientific rights and expectations for the future on your data, like:

-   Citation format to be used when giving credit for the data
-   Attribution expectations for the dataset
-   Reuse rights, which describe who may use the data and for what purpose
-   Redistribution rights, which describe who may copy and redistribute the metadata and the data
-   Legal terms and conditions like how the data are licensed for reuse.

### Metadata Standards

So, **how does a computer organize all this information?** There are a number of metadata standards that make your metadata machine readable and therefore easier for data curators to publish your data.

-   [Ecological Metadata Language (EML)](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/)
-   [Geospatial Metadata Standards (ISO 19115 and ISO 19139)](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/iso-standards)
    -   See [NOAA's ISO Workbook](http://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/ISO%2019115-2%20Workbook_Part%20II%20Extentions%20for%20imagery%20and%20Gridded%20Data.pdf)
-   [Biological Data Profile (BDP)](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/metadata/biometadata/biodatap.pdf)
-   [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/)
-   [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/)
-   [PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/)
-   [Metadata Encoding Transmission Standard (METS)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/)

*Note this is not an exhaustive list.*

### Data Identifiers

Many journals require a DOI (a digital object identifier) be assigned to the published data before the paper can be accepted for publication. The reason for that is so that the data can easily be found and easily linked to.

Some data repositories assign a DOI for each dataset you publish on their repository. But, if you need to update the datasets, check the policy of the data repository. Some repositories assign a new DOI after you update the dataset. If this is the case, researchers should cite the exact version of the dataset that they used in their analysis, even if there is a newer version of the dataset available.

### Data Citation

Researchers should get in the habit of citing the data that they use (even if it's their own data!) in each publication that uses that data.

## Data Sharing & Preservation

![](images/WhyManage-small.png)

### Data Packages

> We define a data package as a scientifically useful collection of data and metadata that a researcher wants to preserve.

Sometimes a data package represents all of the data from a particular experiment, while at other times it might be all of the data from a grant, or on a topic, or associated with a paper. Whatever the extent, we define a data package as having one or more data files, software files, and other scientific products such as graphs and images, all tied together with a descriptive metadata document.

Many data repositories assign a unique identifier to every version of every data file, similarly to how it works with source code commits in GitHub. Those identifiers usually take one of two forms. A DOI identifier, often assigned to the metadata and becomes a publicly citable identifier for the package. Each of the other files gets a global identifier, often a UUID that is globally unique. This allows to identify a digital entity within a data package.

In the graphic to the side, the package can be cited with the DOI `doi:10.5063/F1Z1899CZ`,and each of the individual files have their own identifiers as well.

### Data Repositories: Built for Data (and code)

-   GitHub is not an archival location
-   Examples of dedicated data repositories:
    -   KNB
    -   Arctic Data Center
    -   tDAR
    -   EDI
    -   Zenodo
-   Dedicated data repositories are:
    -   Rich in metadata
    -   Archival in their mission
    -   [Certified](https://www.coretrustseal.org/)
-   Data papers, e.g., Scientific Data
-   [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) is a global registry of research data repositories
-   [Repository Finder](https://repositoryfinder.datacite.org/) is a pilot project and tool to help researchers find an appropriate repository for their work

#### DataOne Federation

DataONE is a federation of dozens of data repositories that work together to make their systems interoperable and to provide a single unified search system that spans the repositories. DataONE aims to make it simpler for researchers to publish data to one of its member repositories, and then to discover and download that data for reuse in synthetic analyses.

DataONE can be [searched on the web](https://search.dataone.org/), which effectively allows a single search to find data from the dozens of members of DataONE, rather than visiting each of the (currently 44!) repositories one at a time.
