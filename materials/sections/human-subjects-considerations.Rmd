In addition to equity related challenges in promoting open
access, there are also *different disciplinary norms and requirements*
that can create challenges for the adoption of open science
practices. For example, traditional social science methods training
and IRB processes emphasize confidentiality and privacy. Social
scientists generally lack access to training about benefits of sharing
data. On the other hand, social scientists are often trained to be
attuned to issues of equity and access, including issues related to
information equity. Those who lack this background may not give
adequate attention or time to the process of partnering with
communities. The [Arctic Horizons Report](https://jeffersoninst.org/sites/default/files/Arctic%20Horizons%20Final%20Report%281%29.pdf) reviewed challenges around
social science data management. In 2020, a [workshop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vv054wQNaQDH6mm5Eit2fQZT-8U-G0vq/view) organized by the
Arctic Data Center reviewed some of the challenges for sharing and
reusing social science data, including:

* Data heterogeneity, including “unstructured” data that is not always
  well supported by data repositories;  
* A dearth of metadata support for social sciences, with repositories
  not always offering relevant metadata fields;  
* A lack of “formal vocabularies” that limits findability of social
science data in searches; Limited training and support in data
management practices for social scientists; limited examples using
social science data in interdisciplinary trainings.  

In addition to these challenges, a number of broader concerns about
sharing data were identified, including:

* Concerns about proper handling of sensitive data; importance of
  upholding IRB and ethics requirements, data sharing/use agreements;  
* Importance of context - researchers may feel that data reuse is too
difficult given lack of contextual knowledge;  
* Concerns about upholding Indigenous data sovereignty.  

### The role of IRBs, funding agencies, and Indigenous data

In the **United States**, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs; in **Canada**
they are referred to as Research Ethics Boards or REBs) focus on
ensuring ethical treatment and protection of research subjects with a
particular focus on vulnerable populations and ethical management of
data. For projects proposing research that involves Indigenous peoples
in the United States, IRBs will often refer the review to Tribal IRBs,
which are research review boards established and implemented directly
by Tribal Nations. Tribal IRBs reflect and respond to community needs,
changes in research, and revisions to research policy (Around Him et
al. 2019). Oversight mechanisms range from federally registered review
bodies and policy development to community-specific frameworks and
approaches (see Around Him et al. 2019 for differentiation,
justification and authority).

In addition to IRB review, universities require ethics training for
researchers who are doing research with human subjects, including
Indigenous Peoples.  Many universities use the web-based, third-party
[CITI training program](https://about.citiprogram.org/), which offers different short courses.  A basic
training course for social and behavioral science researchers covers
the history of ethical misconduct in research, how human subjects
research is defined, federal regulations that govern research
practice, assessing risk, informed consent, privacy and
confidentiality, and ethics requirements for different categories of
vulnerable populations including prisoners and children.  While the
CITI human subjects trainings touch on topics related to Indigenous
peoples, they are not at all comprehensive. A CITI webinar, “[Research
with Native American Communities: Important Considerations when
Applying Federal Regulations](https://about.citiprogram.org/news/new-webinar-available-research-with-native-american-communities-important-considerations-when-applying-federal-regulations/)” introduces more topics.  The r-ETHICS
training ([Ethics Training for Health in Indigenous Communities Study](http://iwri.org/research/ethics/))
is starting to become an acceptable, recognizable CITI addition for
IRB training by tribal entities.

Specific **universities** have adopted tribal consultation policies (such
as the Arizona Board of Regents’ (ABOR) Tribal Consultation policy
(1-118) adopted in 2016; University of Wisconsin System Board of
Regents tribal consultation policy adopted in 2021; Washington State
University [EP 41](https://policies.wsu.edu/prf/index/manuals/executive-policy-manual-contents/ep41-policy-on-tribal-engagement-consultation-and-consent-for-joint-wsu-tribal-research-activities-and-projects/) adopted in 2021). These policies highlight where
consultation is expected/required and what the process should be
(Marley 2019).

In the United States, the [Inter-Agency Arctic Research Policy Committee has established the Principles for Conducting Research in the Arctic](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/arctic/conduct.jsp) (2018) with input from the  Arctic research community, which are:

- Be Accountable
- Establish Effective Communication
- Respect Indigenous Knowledge and Cultures
- Build and Sustain Relationships
- Pursue Responsible Environmental Stewardship

Along with the Principles for Conducting Research in the Arctic, the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) has also published a list of resources: Conducting Research with Northern Communities - Documented Practices for Productive, Respectful Relationships Between Researchers and Community Members (https://www.arcus.org/resources/northern-communities). 

IRBs are not necessarily aware of these principles but national funding agencies may use them to inform proposal reviewers about expectations for research projects that work with Arctic communities.

## Working with Arctic Communities

**High level frameworks in support of Indigenous Data Sovereignty:**

* The **UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**, which
recognizes the collective rights of Indigenous peoples. **Article 18** of
UNDRIP **recognizes the right of Indigenous Peoples to participate in
decision-making** about matters that affect their rights; **Article 19**
**recognizes the requirement for states to consult and cooperate with
Indigenous Peoples to gain their Free Prior and Informed Consent** on
legislation that affects them. Other international protocols such as
**Nagoya Protocol** on access and benefit sharing and the **Cartagena
Protocol on Biosafety** (UNCBD) also recognize Indigenous rights with
reference to intellectual property and the right to benefit from
Indigenous knowledge and data as the owners/stewards of that data.


**Mid-level frameworks:**

 * The First Nations Principles of [OCAP®](https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/) (ownership, control, access, possession). Developed by the First Nations Information Governance Centre, which has developed good educational materials explaining the principles and how to implement them, as well as a training course (available on their website; the class has a registration fee).    
 * [Inuit Circumpolar Council’s Ethical and Equitable Engagement Synthesis](https://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/project/icc-ethical-and-equitable-engagement-synthesis-report/). This synthesis summarizes the process and approach that ICC took to develop principles of ethical and equitable engagement for Inuit, which involved broad engagement and input from Inuit in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Chukotka. ICC is working on a full set of principles, which will be released after they have gone through review.  
 * [National Inuit Strategy on Research](https://www.itk.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ITK_NISR-Report_English_low_res.pdf). Developed by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the National Inuit Organization of Canada, with input from the Inuit regions of northern Canada. The research strategy discusses Indigenous data sovereignty.
 * In Alaska, the Alaska Native Knowledge Center developed [Guidelines for Respecting Cultural Knowledge](http://www.ankn.uaf.edu/publications/Knowledge.pdf). These include specific guidelines for authors and illustrators, curriculum developers and administrators, educators, editors and publishers, document reviewers, researchers, native language specialists, native community organizers, and the general public.
 * [Principles of Māori Data Sovereignty](https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/nga-rauemi) (Te Mana Rararunga) - Developed by the Maori Data Sovereignty Network (Maui Hudson is a founding member of this network).  
 * [Maiam nayri Wingara key principles](https://www.maiamnayriwingara.org/key-principles) developed by the Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective.    

**Foundational level frameworks:**

![](images/2022-03_assw_dataethics11.png)

* Tribal or community-level expectations/frameworks - such as [Native Village of Kotzebue’s Research Protocol](https://www.kotzebueira.org/wp-content/uploads/Native-Village-of-Kotzebue-Environmental-Program-February-2022-1-1.pdf) (Whiting 2022), which requests that researchers follow ethical research practices pertaining to informed consent and:

    + Inform the Tribe of plan to research and continue to inform them
       after permission has been granted;
    + Consult with the Tribe in project development, implementation and planning.
    + Explain the purposes, goals, time frame, and methodology of the
       research, including the sponsoring institutions and
       affiliations of the research project and identify the person in
       charge, as well as all investigators involved in the research,
       and the need for consultants, guides, or interpreters and
       proposed compensation rates for same  
    + Share results with the Tribe in non-technical language
    + Give credit to those contributing to the research project by
    acknowledging the Intellectual Property Rights of individual
    Tribal citizens taking part in the research (unless there are
    requirements for anonymity)
    + Recognize that all information belongs to the Tribe and
    divulgence of such information is expressly forbidden without
    permission of the Tribe;
    + Compensate Indigenous Knowledge holders fairly for sharing their knowledge.
    

### Human Subject Case Examples and Discussion 

#### Case One
![](images/human-subjects-blood-samples.png)

** Discussion **
This case study illustrates the important issue of explicit consent. 
1. Are there any other ethical considerations are apparent?
1. Does consent play a role in your research, and if so, how does consent inform and influence your research methodologies?


#### Case Two
![](images/human-subjects-thyroid.png)
This is a case study of research conducted in Alaska. The research occurred in the 1950s and the purpose of the study was to understand how the thyroid gland helps humans adapt to the Arctic climate. Research subjects were given a radioactive medical tracer - idoine-131. There were 102 Native American research subjects, and 19 Air Force and Army service men. Most of the Native American subjects did not realize they were part of research - they thought they were receiving medical attention. Furthermore, none of the research subjects knew that they were given a radioactive medical tracer.

**Discussion** 
While this is an extreme example of lack of consent and extractive research practices, it illustrates the problematic history of between researchers and Indigenous Peoples. 
1. What elements of this example relate to any of the policies or principles we have discussed?
1. What are the main takeaways from our discussion on research and data ethics so far?

#### Case Three
The following case is from an NSF funded project with the Association for Practical and Professional Ethics, titled "Do the Ends Justify the Means? The Ethics of Deception in Social Science Research". While these cases are not directly related to the Arctic, they bring up interesting points that are relevant to interdisciplinary and social science research beyond a specific geographic scope.

Ann Smith is a social psychologist who wants to study attitude change. She submits a proposal to her institution outlining details of a study that will examine the attitude change of participants following a workshop on environmental issues. Smith plans to identify attitude change by administering a pretest and a post-test. She is worried, however, that the participants will recognize that she is looking for changes in their attitudes and that this knowledge will influence their answers on the pos-ttest. To address this problem, she plans to disguise the issues she is most interested in; when she administers the tests, she will give a very broad explanation that does not fully disclose the nature of the study. Her proposal includes these procedures and an explanation of why she believes they are necessary; she also includes a plan to "debrief" the subjects (tell them the real purpose of the study) after they finish taking the second test.

**Discussion Questions**
1.   What might be the benefits of this research, if any? What risks to subjects, if any, do you identify?
1. What issues should members of the Institutional Review Board (IRB)(1) raise regarding Smith's proposal?
1. If you were a member of the IRB, how would you weigh the benefits of the research with the risks to subjects in this case?
1. Based on your assessment of the benefits and risks, would you approve Smith's proposal as submitted? If not, what changes would you suggest?
1. Is deception of subjects ever justifiable? If so, under what conditions?
1. How might conducting experiments that involve deception of subjects affect the researcher? Is there any way in which such experiments could reflect upon science itself? If so, how?
