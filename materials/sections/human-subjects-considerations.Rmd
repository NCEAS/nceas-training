### The role of IRBs, funding agencies, and Indigenous data

In the **United States**, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs; in **Canada**
they are referred to as Research Ethics Boards or REBs) focus on
ensuring ethical treatment and protection of research subjects with a
particular focus on vulnerable populations and ethical management of
data. For projects proposing research that involves Indigenous peoples
in the United States, IRBs will often refer the review to Tribal IRBs,
which are research review boards established and implemented directly
by Tribal Nations. Tribal IRBs reflect and respond to community needs,
changes in research, and revisions to research policy (Around Him et
al. 2019). Oversight mechanisms range from federally registered review
bodies and policy development to community-specific frameworks and
approaches (see Around Him et al. 2019 for differentiation,
justification and authority).

In addition to IRB review, universities require ethics training for
researchers who are doing research with human subjects, including
Indigenous Peoples.  Many universities use the web-based, third-party
[CITI training program](https://about.citiprogram.org/), which offers different short courses.  A basic
training course for social and behavioral science researchers covers
the history of ethical misconduct in research, how human subjects
research is defined, federal regulations that govern research
practice, assessing risk, informed consent, privacy and
confidentiality, and ethics requirements for different categories of
vulnerable populations including prisoners and children.  While the
CITI human subjects trainings touch on topics related to Indigenous
peoples, they are not at all comprehensive. A CITI webinar, “[Research
with Native American Communities: Important Considerations when
Applying Federal Regulations](https://about.citiprogram.org/news/new-webinar-available-research-with-native-american-communities-important-considerations-when-applying-federal-regulations/)” introduces more topics.  The r-ETHICS
training ([Ethics Training for Health in Indigenous Communities Study](http://iwri.org/research/ethics/))
is starting to become an acceptable, recognizable CITI addition for
IRB training by tribal entities.

Specific **universities** have adopted tribal consultation policies (such
as the Arizona Board of Regents’ (ABOR) Tribal Consultation policy
(1-118) adopted in 2016; University of Wisconsin System Board of
Regents tribal consultation policy adopted in 2021; Washington State
University [EP 41](https://policies.wsu.edu/prf/index/manuals/executive-policy-manual-contents/ep41-policy-on-tribal-engagement-consultation-and-consent-for-joint-wsu-tribal-research-activities-and-projects/) adopted in 2021). These policies highlight where
consultation is expected/required and what the process should be
(Marley 2019).

In the United States, the [Inter-Agency Arctic Research Policy Committee has established the Principles for Conducting Research in the Arctic](https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/arctic/conduct.jsp) (2018) with input from the  Arctic research community, which are:

- Be Accountable
- Establish Effective Communication
- Respect Indigenous Knowledge and Cultures
- Build and Sustain Relationships
- Pursue Responsible Environmental Stewardship

IRBs are not necessarily aware of these principles but national funding agencies may use them to inform proposal reviewers about expectations for research projects that work with Arctic communities.
