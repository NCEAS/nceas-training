### Learning Objectives

In this lesson we will:

-   explore an example of RMarkdown as literate analysis
-   learn markdown syntax
-   write and run R code in RMarkdown
-   build and knit an example document

### Introduction and motivation

The concept of literate analysis dates to a [1984 article by Donald Knuth](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf). In this article, Knuth proposes a reversal of the programming paradigm.

> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a *computer* what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to *human beings* what we want a computer to do.

If our aim is to make scientific research more transparent, the appeal of this paradigm reversal is immediately apparent. All too often, computational methods are written in such a way as to be borderline incomprehensible - even to the person who originally wrote the code! The reason for this is obvious, computers interpret information very differently than people do. By switching to a literate analysis model, you help enable human understanding of what the computer is doing. As Knuth describes, in the literate analysis model, the author is an "essayist" who chooses variable names carefully, explains what they mean, and introduces concepts in the analysis in a way that facilitates understanding.

RMarkdown is an excellent way to generate literate analysis, and a reproducible workflow. RMarkdown is a combination of two things - R, the programming language, and markdown, a set of text formatting directives. In R, the language assumes that you are writing R code, unless you specify that you are writing prose (using a comment, designated by `#`). The paradigm shift of literate analysis comes in the switch to RMarkdown, where instead of assuming you are writing code, Rmarkdown assumes that you are writing prose unless you specify that you are writing code. This, along with the formatting provided by markdown, encourages the "essayist" to write understandable prose to accompany the code that explains to the human-beings reading the document what the author told the computer to do, as opposed to just explaining to the computer what to do.

Before we dive in deeper, let's look at an example of what literate analysis with RMarkdown can look like using a real example. [Here](https://nceas.github.io/sasap-training/materials/reproducible_research_in_r_fairbanks/example-brood-table-analysis.html) is an example of a real analysis workflow written using RMarkdown.

Here are some things to notice about this document, which assembles a set of similar data sources on salmon brood tables with different formatting into a single data source.

-   It introduces the data sources using in-line images, links, interactive tables, and interactive maps.
-   An example of document formatting using R is shown.
-   The document executes a set of formatting scripts in a directory to generate a single merged file.
-   Some simple quality checks are performed (and their output shown) on the merged data.
-   Simple analysis and plots are shown.

In addition to achieving literate analysis, this document also represents a **reproducible analysis.** Because the entire merging and quality control of the data is done using the R code in the RMarkdown, if a new data source and formatting script are added, the document can be run all at once with a single click to re-generate the quality control, plots, and analysis of the updated data.

RMarkdown is an amazing tool to use for collaborative research, so we will spend some time learning it well now, and use it through the rest of the course.

#### Setup

Open a new RMarkdown file using the following prompts:

File -\> New File -\> RMarkdown

A popup window will appear. You can just click the OK button here, or give your file a new title if you wish. Leave the output format as HTML.

### Basic RMarkdown syntax

The first thing to notice is that by opening a file, we are seeing the 4th pane of the RStudio console, which is essentially a text editor. This lets us organize our files within RStudio instead of having a bunch of different windows open.

Let's have a look at this file --- it's not blank; there is some initial text already provided for you. Notice a few things about it:

-   There are white and grey sections. R code is in grey sections, and other text is in white.

![](../images/rmarkdown.png)

<br>

Let's go ahead and "Knit HTML" by clicking the blue yarn at the top of the RMarkdown file. When you first click this button, RStudio will prompt you to save this file. Create a new folder for it somewhere that you will be able to find again (such as your Desktop or Documents), and name that folder something you'll remember (like `arctic_training_files`).

<br>

![](../images/rmarkdown_side_by_side.png)

What do you notice between the two?

Notice how the grey **R code chunks** are surrounded by 3 backticks and `{r LABEL}`. These are evaluated and return the output text in the case of `summary(cars)` and the output plot in the case of `plot(pressure)`.

Notice how the code `plot(pressure)` is not shown in the HTML output because of the R code chunk option `echo = FALSE`. RMarkdown has lots of chunk options, including ones that allow for code to be run but not shown (`echo = FALSE`), code to be shown but not run (`eval = FALSE`), code to be run, but results not shown (`results = 'hide'`), or any combination of those.

More details...

This RMarkdown file has 2 different languages within it: **R** and **Markdown**.

You can see that we are taking a summary of some data called 'cars', and then plotting. There's a lot more to learn about R, and we'll get into it for the next few days.

The second language is Markdown. This is a formatting language for plain text, and there are only about 15 rules to know.

Notice the syntax for:

-   **headers** get rendered at multiple levels: `#`, `##`
-   **bold**: `**word**`

There are some good [cheatsheets](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) to get you started, and here is one built into RStudio: Go to Help \> Markdown Quick Reference <br /> <br />

**Important**: note that the hash symbol `#` is used differently in Markdown and in R:

-   in R, a hash indicates a comment that will not be evaluated. You can use as many as you want: `#` is equivalent to `######`. It's just a matter of style.
-   in Markdown, a hash indicates a level of a header. And the number you use matters: `#` is a "level one header", meaning the biggest font and the top of the hierarchy. `###` is a level three header, and will show up nested below the `#` and `##` headers.

#### Challenge {.exercise}

1.  In Markdown, Write some italic text, and make a numbered list. And add a few subheaders. Use the Markdown Quick Reference (in the menu bar: Help \> Markdown Quick Reference).
2.  Reknit your html file.

### Code chunks

First, do what I do every time I open a new RMarkdown: delete everything below the "setup chunk" (line 10). The setup chunk is the one that looks like this: 

```
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a very useful chunk that will set the default R chunk options for your entire document. I like keeping it in my document so that I can easily modify default chunk options based on the audience for my RMarkdown. For example, if I know my document is going to be a report for a non-technical audience, I might set `echo = FALSE` in my setup chunk, that way all of the text, plots, and tables appear in the knitted document. The code is still run, but doesn't display in the final document.

OK. Now let's practice with some R chunks. You can Create a new chunk in your RMarkdown in one of these ways:

-   click "Insert \> R" at the top of the editor pane
-   type by hand \`\`\`{r} \`\`\`
-   using the keyboard shortcut Command + Option + i (for windows, Ctrl + alt + i)


Now, let's write some R code.

    x <- 4*3
    x

Now, hitting return does not execute this command; remember, it's just a text file. To execute it, we need to get what we typed in the the R chunk (the grey R code) down into the console. How do we do it? There are several ways (let's do each of them):

1.  copy-paste this line into the console (generally not recommended as a primary method)

2.  select the line (or simply put the cursor there), and click 'Run'. This is available from

    a.  the bar above the file (green arrow)
    b.  the menu bar: Code \> Run Selected Line(s)
    c.  keyboard shortcut: command-return

3.  click the green arrow at the right of the code chunk

#### Challenge {.exercise}

Add a few more commands to your code chunk. Execute them by trying the three ways above. 

**Question**: What is the difference between running code using the green arrow in the chunk and the command-return keyboard shortcut?


### Literate analysis practice

Now that we have gone over the basics, let's go a little deeper by building a simple, small RMarkdown document that represents a literate analysis.

#### Setup

- Navigate to the following dataset: [https://doi.org/10.18739/A25T3FZ8X](https://doi.org/10.18739/A25T3FZ8X)
- Download the file "BGchem2008data.csv"
- Move the downloaded file from your Downloads directory into the *same* directory you have saved this file (eg: arctic-training-files).

#### Introduction to the dataset

Since this is a literate analysis, one of the things we will need to do in order to explain our analysis is explain, at least briefly, what the dataset is and where it came from. With that in mind do the following exercise:

##### Challenge {.exercise}

Write an introduction section in Markdown, below your setup chunk, that includes the following items:

- Top level introduction header
- Sentence or two about the dataset, including a citation (it can be plain text)
- Hyperlink to the dataset

#### Read in the data

To read the data into our environment, we will use a function from the `readr` package. R packages are the building blocks of computational reproducibility in R. Each package contains a set of related functions that enable you to more easily do a task or set of tasks in R. There are thousands of community-maintained packages out there for just about every imaginable use of R - including many that you have probably never thought of!

To install a package, we use the syntax `install.packages('packge_name')`. A package only needs to be installed once, so this code can be run directly in the console if needed. To use a package in our analysis, we need to load it into our environment using `library(package_name)`. Loading the library is a key part of the reproducible aspect of our Rmarkdown, so we will include it as an R chunk. It is generally good practice to include all of your `library` calls in a single, dedicated R chunk near the top of your document. This lets collaborators know what packages they might need to install before they start running your code.

You should have already installed `readr` as part of the setup for this course, so add a new R chunk below your setup chunk that calls the `readr` library. It should look like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
```


Now, below the introduction that you wrote, add a chunk that uses the `read_csv` function to read in your data file.

##### About RMarkdown paths {-#about-rmarkdown-paths}

In computing, a path specifies the unique location of a file on the filesystem. A path can come in one of two forms: absolute or relative. **Absolute** paths start at the very top of your file system, and work their way down the directory tree to the file. **Relative** paths start at an arbitrary point in the file system. In R, this point is set by your working directory. 

RMarkdown has a special way of handling relative paths that can be very handy. When working in an RMarkdown document, R will set all paths relative **to the location of the RMarkdown file.** This way, you don't have to worry about setting a working directory, or changing your colleagues absolute path structure with the correct user name, etc. If your RMarkdown is stored near where the data it analyses are stored (good practice, generally), setting paths becomes much easier!

If you saved your "BGchem2008data.csv" data file in the same location as your Rmd, you can just write the following to read it in. The help page (`?read_csv`, in the console) for this function tells you that the first argument should be a pointer to the file.

```{r, eval = F}
bg_chem <- read_csv("BGchem2008data.csv")
```

```
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  Date = col_date(format = ""),
  Time = col_datetime(format = ""),
  Station = col_character(),
  Latitude = col_double(),
  Longitude = col_double(),
  Target_Depth = col_double(),
  CTD_Depth = col_double(),
  CTD_Salinity = col_double(),
  CTD_Temperature = col_double(),
  Bottle_Salinity = col_double(),
  d18O = col_double(),
  Ba = col_double(),
  Si = col_double(),
  NO3 = col_double(),
  NO2 = col_double(),
  NH4 = col_double(),
  P = col_double(),
  TA = col_double(),
  O2 = col_double()
)
Warning messages:
1: In get_engine(options$engine) :
  Unknown language engine 'markdown' (must be registered via knit_engines$set()).
2: Problem with `mutate()` input `Lower`.
ℹ NAs introduced by coercion
ℹ Input `Lower` is `as.integer(Lower)`. 
3: In mask$eval_all_mutate(dots[[i]]) : NAs introduced by coercion
```

```{r echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bg_chem <- read_csv("../data/BGchem2008data.csv")
```

If you run this line in your RMarkdown document, you should see the `bg_chem` object populate in your environment pane. It also spits out lots of text explaining what types the function parsed each column into. This text is important, and should be examined, but we might not want it in our final document. 

##### Challenge {.exercise}

Use one of two methods to figure out how to suppress **warning** and **message** text in your chunk output:

1. The gear icon in the chunk, next to the play button
2. The [RMarkdown quick reference](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)

#### Aside {-#aside}

Why not use `read.csv` from base R? We chose to show `read_csv` from the `readr` package for a few reasons. One is to introduce the concept of packages and showing how to load them, but `read_csv` has several advantages over `read.csv`.

- more reasonable function defaults (no stringsAsFactors!)
- smarter column type parsing, especially for dates
- it is **much** faster than `read.csv`, which is helpful for large files

#### Calculate Summary Statistics

As our "analysis" we are going to calculate some very simple summary statistics and generate a single plot.


### Troubleshooting

#### My RMarkdown won't knit to PDF

If you get an error when trying to knit to PDF that says your computer doesn't have a LaTeX installation, one of two things is likely happening:

1.  Your computer doesn't have LaTeX installed
2.  You have an installation of LaTeX but RStudio cannot find it (it is not on the path)

If you already use LaTeX (like to write papers), you fall in the second category. Solving this requires directing RStudio to your installation - and isn't covered here.

If you fall in the first category - you are sure you don't have LaTeX installed - can use the R package `tinytex` to easily get an installation recognized by RStudio, as long as you have administrative rights to your computer.

To install `tinytex` run:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

If you get an error that looks like `destination /usr/local/bin not writable`, you need to give yourself permission to write to this directory (again, only possible if you have administrative rights). To do this, run this command in the terminal:

    sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/bin

and then try the above install instructions again. More information about `tinytex` can be found [here](https://yihui.name/tinytex/)

### Exercise

Create an RMarkdown document with some of your own data. If you don't have a good dataset handy, use the example dataset here:

[Craig Tweedie. 2009. North Pole Environmental Observatory Bottle Chemistry. Arctic Data Center. doi:10.18739/A25T3FZ8X.](http://doi.org/10.18739/A25T3FZ8X)

Your document should contain the following sections:

-   Introduction to your dataset

    -   Include an external link

-   Simple analysis

-   Presentation of a result

    -   A plot
    -   In-line description of results
