synthesis,elements,benefits,limitations
narrative review,"summary, insights, next steps","more opinion, can be shorter, less detailed processing the research literature",can be less compelling without some specific evidence listed and is difficult to repeat 
systematic review,"summary, insights, next steps, explanation of how studies were selected in the review, can have counts of ideas tested","more specific, can be repeated, and can be more compelling","need to keep track of how you selected papers, need to sort through papers in more detail in addition to capturing main ideas"
meta-analyses,all of above possible but must also include an assessment of the strength of evidence of each study included in the synthesis,"gold standard, reader can get a sense of how effective a treatment or intervention is relative to another",need to extract means or measures of efficacy with sample sizes or variance from each study
