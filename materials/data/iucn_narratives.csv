Sexual reproduction is important, but asexual reproduction and fragmentation are more effective strategies for colonizing free areas within the reef (Cortés and Guzmán 1998). <em>Psammocora</em> species are considered to be amongst the most opportunistic species because of the capacity to rapidly recolonize open areas after disturbances (Guzmán and Cortés 2001).","The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was five. <br/><br/>The sea star <em>Acanthaster planci</em> and the fish <em>Arothron meleagris</em> feed on <em>Psammocora</em> species (Cortés and Guzmán 1998,Reyes-Bonilla <em>et al</em>. 1999). According to Cortés and Guzmán (1998), the puffer fish <em>Arothron meleagris</em> is capable of reducing populations of <em>Psammocora</em> species if other preferred coral species such as <em>Porites lobata</em> are absent.<br/><br/>In Galápagos, following the 1982-83 El Niño event <em>P. stellata</em> experienced extreme population reductions at Española Island (Glynn 1997); in Costa Rica, after the 1991-92 ENSO event ~40% of all colonies were dead in Manuel Antonio (Jiménez and Cortés 2001), and after the 1997-98 El Niño event <em>P. stellata</em> disappeared from one locality (Punta Cambial) in Costa Rica (Jiménez and Cortés 2003). Despite the fact that <em>Psammocora stellata</em> is affected by ENSO events, this species is more resistant to bleaching than shallow water corals such as <em>Pocillopora</em> (Feingold 1995). Additionally, <em>Psammocora stellata</em> has also shown resistance to anomalous conditions during ENSO events (Feingold 1995, Feingold 1996, Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2001). At Devils Crown, Floreana (Galápagos), <em>Psammocora stellata</em> bleached during the 1982-83 El Niño event but did not die (Robinson 1985). <br/><br/>Algae overgrowth has also been reported to cause mortality on <em>Psammocora</em> (Glynn 1997, Jiménez and Cortés 2001, Bernadette <em>et al</em>. 2006). At Uva Island, Panama, large aggregations of <em>P. stellata</em> at 8-10 m depth that survived the 1982-83 El Niño event were overgrown by thick mats of Caulerpa species (Glynn 1997); additionally, in Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica, <em>Psammocora</em> species were completely overgrown by a brown algae (Jimenez and Cortés 2001).

Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

However, this species is also highly susceptible to disease and harvesting for aquarium trade. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range, with a low susceptibility to bleaching, and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 19% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

In addition to global climate change, corals are also threatened by  a number of localized threats. Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities.

In addition to global climate change, corals are also threatened by  a number of localized threats. Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities.

Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is found in an area of high coral reef reduction and is rare throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 23% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, this species is susceptible to habitat reduction therefore it is listed as Near Threatened.

Its threat susceptibility increases the likelihood of being lost within one generation in the future from reefs at a critical stage.

This is not a particularly common coral (Wood 1983).<br/><br/><strong>Population trend</strong><br/><strong><em>Eastern Tropical Pacific</em></strong>: Increasing.<br/>In terms of relative abundance within the Eastern Tropical Pacific, <em>G. planulata</em> has been categorized as (Glynn and Ault 2000, Reyes-Bonilla 2003, Guzmán and Cortés 2001): common: Caño Island, Costa Rica; uncommon: Cocos Island, Costa Rica; Panamá; Colombia (including Malpelo Island); rare: Mexico; mainland Costa Rica, and Ecuador (including the Galápagos Archipelago). <br/><br/>According to Glynn (1997), prior to the 1982-83 ENSO event approximately 100 colonies were present in Costa Rica (Caño Island) and 26 colonies in Galápagos (central southern islands). After that ENSO event, only 10 colonies survived in Costa Rica, and two colonies in the central southern islands of the Galapagos Archipelago (Glynn 1997). In 1998, only one single colony was known in the Galapagos central southern islands (at Punta Estrada, Santa Cruz), with a combined total of approx. 550 cm² live tissue. This colony was totally bleached on 11 May 1998 (Glynn 1998), and has not been found since (Glynn 2001), although another colony in the region on Champion Island is now known (Edgar pers. comm.).<br/><br/>According to Guzmán and Cortés (2001), the number of colonies in Costa Rica (including Cocos Island) and Panamá are increasing (Guzmán and Cortés 2001). In addition, Guzmán <em>et al</em>. (2004), reported G. planulata as a very common species in Coiba Archipelago, found in 50 to 75% of the sites; and, according to Guzmán <em>et al</em>. (in prep.) G. planulata is common at the Gulf of Chiriqui (46% of the sites), as well as in Las Perlas Archipelago (35% of the sites). The species is also moderately common at Malpelo, Colombia (Edgar pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In Galapagos, after a major population decline following 1982-83 ENSO event; a few isolated patches have persisted and are possibly increasing in number at Darwin and Wolf islands (Chiriboga, Hickman and Edgar pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong><em>Rest of the world</em></strong>: Usually uncommon.<br/>However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is more resilient to some of the threats faced by corals and therefore population decline is estimated using the percentage of destroyed reefs only (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage of destroyed reefs. Reef losses throughout the species' range have been estimated over three generations, two in the past and one projected into the future.<br/><br/>The age of first maturity of most reef building corals is typically three to eight years (Wallace 1999) and therefore we assume that average age of mature individuals is greater than eight years. Furthermore, based on average sizes and growth rates, we assume that average generation length is 10 years, unless otherwise stated. Total longevity is not known, but likely to be more than ten years. Therefore any population decline rates for the Red List assessment are measured over at least 30 years.&#160;<strong>See the Supplementary Material&#160;for further details on population decline and generation length estimates</strong>.",unknown,"This species is found in shallow, tropical reef environments from 2-30 m. Colonies are massive to encrusting, sometimes with laminar margins. It usually occurs on walls or under overhangs in clear water  This species can be found in most reef habitats but is not a particularly common coral (Wood 1983). Sparse colonies of <em>G. planulata</em> are found from 9-15 m in the South China Sea and Gulf of Siam (Titlyanov and Titlyanova 2002).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Tropical Pacific region <em>G. planulata</em> usually occurs on coral reefs and coral communities on rocky substrata at depths of 3-30 m (Guzmán, Chiriboga and Edgar pers. comm.); it also occurs on walls or under overhangs in clear water. <em>G. planulata</em> colonies are among the predominant framework builders in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region (Glynn 2000). <em>G. planulata</em> has reported average growth rates of 10.4 and 13.2 mm per year in Costa Rica and Panama, respectively (Guzmán and Cortés 1989, and Glynn 1985). Reproduction of <em>G. planulata</em> is mainly sexual (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1996). <em>G. planulata</em> is a broadcast spawner (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1996), with an alternating periodic sequential hermaphrodite mode of reproduction (spawning of first one sex then the other in given colony, in a lunar phase, and over the breeding season (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1996, Glynn <em>et al</em>. 2000). However, <em>G. planulata</em> has a high proportion of mixed sexual patterns, with gonochoric colonies usually predominating over hermaphrodites (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1996). This pattern of sexuality could promote outbreeding during periods of high population abundance, but still allow sexual reproduction by selfing at times of severe population decline (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1996). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1996), the earliest age of sexual reproduction for <em>G. planulata</em> is 20 years; which may retard the recovery of the population, especially in areas that have experienced catastrophic mortality. Gardinoseris planulata has revealed no sexual recruitment where seed populations are absent or rare (Galápagos Islands), and only low recruitment (Panamá) in areas with colonies that survived the ENSO disturbance (Glynn 1996). At Uva Island, Panamá, corals that recruit are subject to significant mortality by <em>Acanthaster planci</em> predation (Glynn 1996). <em>G. planulata</em> colonies are preferred prey for <em>Acanthaster planci</em>; which may affect the population structure and distribution of <em>G. planulata</em> (Fong and Glynn 1998, Glynn 2001). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1996), the slow rates of sexual recruitment of agariciid corals critically affect recovery of eastern Pacific coral communities that have experienced severe disturbances. However, according to Guzmán (pers. comm.) recruits of <em>G. planulata</em> in the Gulfs of Chiriqui and Panama are common on rocky substrates.","Although, <em>G. planulata</em> colonies seem not to be as sensitive to high temperatures as other species of corals (Fong and Glynn 1998), after El Niño 1982-83, approximately 92% of the southern Galápagos population was dead (Glynn 1994, 1997), as well as approximately 90% of the known colonies at Caño Island (Glynn 1997). According to Glynn (1988), El Niño disturbance could have perilous consequences for eastern Pacific small populations reef corals (e.g <em>Gardineroseris planulata</em>). <em>Gardinoseris planulata</em> has revealed no sexual recruitment where seed populations are absent or rare (Galápagos Islands), and only low recruitment (Panamá) in areas with colonies that survived the ENSO disturbance (Glynn 1996).<br/> <br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em> can influence the population structure and distribution of <em>G. planulata</em> in coral reefs (Fong and Glynn 1998, Glynn 2001), but no outbreaks resulting in mass coral mortality are known (Glynn 2001). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was six.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II.

The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II.

132980,132980,NA,"The most important known threat for this species is extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (45 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and is a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the Great Barrier Reef were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification. In addition to global climate change, corals are also threatened by  a number of localized threats. Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities.

Recovery observed since that time was in large part nullified by the 1997-98 ENSO event (Glynn 2000). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>.(1988), pocilloporid coral mortality in the eastern Pacific was high, ranging from 51% at Caño Island to 76-85% in Panama and 97-100% in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1988). <br/><br/>Glynn (1994) suggests that the sea urchin <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (syn. <em>E. thouarsii</em>) provides important biotic control of pocilloporid reef development. This urchin is the most persistent corallivore in the Galapagos Islands, where it is often observed grazing on pocilloporid corals (Glynn 2001). <br/><br/>Overfishing is probably responsible for some ecological imbalance on coral reefs that could prolong recovery from other disturbances (Glynn 2001). Moreover, Edgar <em>et al</em>.(unpublished manuscript) reported that over-exploitation of sea urchin predators (lobsters and fishes), along with ENSO, has a major effect in the condition and distribution of corals in the Galapagos Islands, by increasing the grazer and bioerosion pressure on corals. <br/><br/>Coral mortality associated with phytoplankton blooms has been reported from Caño Island, Costa Rica, and Uva Island, Panama, in 1985; where mortality of pocilloporid species (especially <em>P. capitata</em> and <em>P. elegans</em>) was in the order of 100% and 13% respectively at 3 m depth (Guzmán <em>et al</em>. 1990).<br/><br/>According to Glynn (2001), pocilloporid coral harvesting is an important threat in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, specially along the continental coast. This activity has virtually eliminated pocilloporid corals from Acapulco (Mexico), Bahia Culebra (Costa Rica), Taboga Island (Panama), and parts of the coast of Ecuador (Glynn 2001). Nevertheless, this activity is now largely excluded from Costa Rica and Panama (Guzmán pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Bryant <em>et al</em>. (1998), based on four anthropogenic factors (coastal development; overexploitation and destructive fishing practice; inland pollution and erosion, and marine pollution), estimated a high threat to coral reefs along the coasts of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. High levels of siltation caused by accelerated coastal erosion have degraded coral reefs in Costa Rica, Colombia and Ecuador (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/>Other threats include: a) predation principally by <em>Acanthaster</em> and <em>Jenneria</em> (Glynn 2002, 1994, 2000), and b) harvesting for the curio trade, an activity that has virtually eliminated pocilloporid corals from Acapulco (Mexico), Bahia Culebra (Costa Rica), Taboga Island (Panama), and parts of the coast of Ecuador (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II.

133099,133099,NA,"This species is widespread and locally common throughout its range. However, it is particularly susceptible to bleaching, disease, crown-of-thorns starfish predation, and extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from declines in habitat quality based on the combined estimates of both destroyed reefs and reefs at the critical stage of degradation within its range (Wilkinson 2004). Its threat susceptibility increases the likelihood of being lost within one generation in the future from reefs at a critical stage. Therefore, the estimated habitat degradation and loss of 35% over three generation lengths (15 years) is the best inference of population reduction and meets the threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion A4ce. It will be important to reassess this species in 10 years time because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification.","In the Indo-West Pacific, this species is found in the Central Indo-Pacific, the Oceanic West Pacific, the Central Pacific, Solomon Islands (Veron and Turak 2006) and Papua New Guinea (Fenner 2003) and the Eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, this coral species is present in: <strong>Mexico</strong>: Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Guerreo and Oaxaca (Reyes-Bonilla <em>et al</em>. 2005, Pérez Vivar <em>et al</em>. 2006, Glynn and Ault 2000); <strong>El Salvador</strong>* (Reyes-Bonilla and Barraza 2003); <strong>Costa Rica</strong>: Murcielago Archipelago, Culebra Bay, Peninsula de Osa, Caño Island, and Cocos Island (Cortés and Guzmán 1998); <strong>Panama</strong>: throughout the Gulfs of Chiriqui and Panama (Holst and Guzmán 1993, Maté 2003); <strong>Colombia</strong>: Malpelo Island, Gorgona Island, Ensenada de Utría (Zapata and Vargas-Ángel 2003); <strong>Ecuador</strong>: Salango Island, Los Frailes, Sucre Island and La Plata Island, and throughout the Galápagos Archipelago (except for Fernandina and the west side of Isabela) (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 2001, Glynn 2003, Hickman <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>(*Taxonomic determination requires confirmation (Reyes-Bonilla and Barraza 2003).)","This species is locally common in some regions of the central Indo-Pacific and the far eastern Pacific. <br/><br/>The relative abundance of Pocillopora elegans in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region has been categorized as follows:<br/><br/>Abundant: Mexico, Panama and Colombia (Glynn and Ault 2000).<br/><br/>Common: Gulf of California, Revillagigedo Islands in Mexico, and Ecuador including the Galápagos Archipelago (Glynn and Ault 2000, Glynn 2003). <br/><br/>Uncommon: Malpelo Island, Colombia (Glynn and Ault 2000). <br/><br/>Rare: Costa Rica including Cocos Islands (Glynn and Ault 2000).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, according to Guzmán and Cortes (1989), <em>P. elegans</em> is likely to be abundant in mainland Costa Rica but rare in Cocos Island, and common in Panama (Guzmán et al., in prep.).<br/><br/>Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1988) report high rates of pocilloporid coral mortality across the eastern Pacific following the 1982/83 El Niño, ranging from 51% at Caño Island to 76-85% in Panama and 97-100% in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1988). However, following this high coral mortality, numerous pocilloporid recruits have been observed at some sites in Costa Rica, Panama and the Galapagos Islands (Glynn unpublished data in Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). According to Guzmán (pers. comm.), <em>Pocillopora elegans</em> populations are probably increasing in Costa Rica and Panama following the severe coral mortality of recent ENSO events (1982-83 and 1997-98) and red tides (Guzmán and Cortes 2001). Population trends of <em>P. elegans</em> in the Galápagos Islands are unknown (Edgar and Chiriboga pers. comm.)<br/><br/>In the Galápagos Islands, pocilloporid communities were well developed off northeastern San Cristobal, Espanola and Floreana Island until the 1980s (Glynn 1994, 2003), but disappeared following the 1982-83 ENSO event, with minimal coral recruitment since (Glynn 2003). <br/><br/>In mainland Ecuador at Sucre Island, Machalilla, the predominant frame-building species before 1983 were <em>Pocillopora elegans</em> and <em>Pocillopora damicornis</em>, with the two species generating a rigid framework that covered over 1 ha of bottom (Glynn 2003). However, by 1991 the reef had declined to dispersed colonies of <em>P. damicornis</em> and <em>P. elegans</em> (Glynn 2003).<br/><br/>There is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is particularly susceptible to bleaching, disease, and other threats and therefore population decline is based on both the percentage of destroyed reefs and critical reefs that are likely to be destroyed within 20 years (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage destroyed reefs. Reef losses throughout the species' range have been estimated over three generations, two in the past and one projected into the future.<br/><br/>The age of first maturity of most reef building corals is typically three to eight years (Wallace 1999) and therefore we assume that average age of mature individuals is greater than eight years. Furthermore, based on average sizes and growth rates, we assume that average generation length is 10 years, unless otherwise stated. Total longevity is not known, but likely to be more than ten years. Therefore any population decline rates for the Red List assessment are measured over at least 30 years.&#160;<strong>See the Supplementary Material&#160;for further details on population decline and generation length estimates</strong>.",unknown,"This species occurs in shallow reef environments. <em>Pocillopora elegans</em> occurs in all shallow water habitats on coral reefs and coral communities on rocky substrata (Guzmán <em>et al</em>. pers. comm.), to at least 20 m depth, but is most common between 1-10 m depth (Guzmán and Chiriboga pers. comm.). Maximum size is 25 cm.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, <em>Pocillopora elegans</em> is one of the major reef building species (along with <em>P. damicornis</em>), forming intermeshing compact frameworks that can attain 2-3 m in relief (Guzmán and Cortes 1989, Glynn 2001).<br/><br/>Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the fastest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortés 1993). Reported growth rates of Pocillopora elegans vary little between locations in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, from 3.1 cm per year in Galápagos to 3.32 cm per year in Costa Rica (Guzmán and Cortés 1993). <br/><br/><em>P. elegans</em> is a broadcast spawner (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991), with the capacity to function as a simultaneous hermaphrodite (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1991), larval settlement in the Galápagos Islands presumably has been the predominant mode of recruitment, and the only observed form of recruitment in areas that experienced high mortality (97-100%) in 1983. Asexual reproduction by fragmentation has been reported as an important mechanism for reef recovery in Panama (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). <em>P. elegans</em>, like other pocilloporid species in the eastern Pacific, has low rates of recruitment (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Histological evidence indicates that spawning is likely to occur during a few days around the new moon (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Reproductive activity in the eastern Pacific its related to local thermal regimes, with a generally higher incidence of gravid corals at sites with stable, warm water conditions, or during warming periods in areas that experience significant seasonal variation (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1991) conclude that moderate El Nino warming can stimulate gametogenesis in Galápagos pocilloporid corals.<br/><br/>Pocilloporid corals, presumably including <em>P. elegans</em>, are generally amongst the strongest coral competitors with relatively high rates of calcification (Glynn 2001). However, coral species exhibiting high rates of calcification usually have relatively high mortality rates (Glynn 2000). Pocilloporid corals also usually predominate at shallow depths (1-15 m). Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the highest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortes 1993). They are the principal framework builders on Panamanian reefs (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/><em>Pocillopora</em> species are preyed on by at least nine groups of consumers. These vary in their consumption patterns, but include:<br/><br/>a) Species that bite off colony branch-tips: pufferfishes (<em>Arothron</em>), parrotfishes (<em>Scaridae</em>), filefishes (Monacanthidae) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>b) Species that scrape skeletal surface: hermit crabs (<em>Trizopagurus</em>, <em>Aniculus</em>, and <em>Calcinus</em>) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>c) Species that remove tissues but leave the skeleton intact: gastropods (<em>Jenneria pustulata</em> and <em>Quoyula</em> sp. (Glynn 2002)), buterflyfishes, angelfishes, damselfish (<em>Stegastes acapulcoensis</em>), and <em>Acanthaster planci</em> (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>d) Species that abrade tissues and skeleton: <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/><em>Jenneria</em> and <em>Acanthaster can kill whole, relatively large (approx. 30 cm in diameter) colonies of <em>Pocillopora</em> (Glynn 2002). Pocilloporid species can have crab (<em>Trapezia</em> sp.) and alpheid shrimp as mutualistic symbionts that protect the coral from the attack of the crown-of-thorns sea star <em>A. planci</em> (Glynn 2001).","Pocilloporid species as well as other major reef building corals within the Eastern Tropical Pacific region (<em>Porites</em>, <em>Pavona</em>, <em>Gardinoseris</em>) catastrophically declined in the Galápagos Archipelago and Cocos Island after 1983. Recovery observed since that time was in large part nullified by the 1997-98 ENSO event (Glynn 2000). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>.(1988), pocilloporid coral mortality in the eastern Pacific was high, ranging from 51% at Caño Island to 76-85% in Panama and 97-100% in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1988). <br/><br/>Glynn (1994) suggests that the sea urchin <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (syn. <em>E. thouarsii</em>) provides important biotic control of pocilloporid reef development. This urchin is the most persistent corallivore in the Galapagos Islands, where it is often observed grazing on pocilloporid corals (Glynn 2001). <br/><br/>Overfishing is probably responsible for some ecological imbalance on coral reefs that could prolong recovery from other disturbances (Glynn 2001).

This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this species has a very limited distribution, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

Following the discovery of this species (i.e., September 1992), extensive surveys in presumably suitable habitats have failed to reveal additional populations (Glynn 2001). Additionally, since the four living colonies were moved to the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) aquaria due to a bleached and unhealthy state of the corals, no living colonies are presently known in the wild (Maté 2003, Fenner 2001, Glynn 2001).<br/><br/>After the removal of <em>S. glynni</em> from the wild, signs of bleaching stopped with temperature control; moreover the colonies are now in good health (Guzmán pers. comm.).

(2005) have revealed that it is more likely that S. glynni originated by a breach of the Panama Isthmus, or by a contemporary introduction by ship. <br/><br/>Glynn (1997) suggested that <em>S. glynni</em> could be an ENSO immigrant, and that colonies perhaps settled and started growing sometime between 1982 and 1985. Glynn (1994) agued that this could be possible if there is a source population located in the Gulf of Panama or elsewhere in the equatorial eastern Pacific (Glynn 1997).","During the 1997-98 El Niño event, the four <em>S. glynni</em> colonies started to deteriorate, displaying bleaching and tissue loss (Fenner 2001, Glynn 2001). Due to the unhealthy state of the corals, the four colonies were moved to the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute aquaria (Maté 2003).

These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

In the Mediterranean Sea the species is widespread and can be locally abundant. This coral can form extensive banks, but can also exist as scattered, non-reef forming colonies.</p><p>This is a long lived, colonial species, with an estimated generation length of 30 years. The most extensive populations described to date, inhabiting the Adriatic Sea and Columbretes Islands, have been reported to have severely declined during the past decades, impacted by a range of threats. For example, over nine years the population in the Columbretes Islands declined by between 55 to 80%. Other subpopulations have also been impacted, including the subpopulations from the Gulf of La Spezia, Dardanelles (Marmara Sea, Turkey) and Cyprus, although quantitative measures of declines are not available. Although declines can not be measured over the past three generation lengths (~90 years), the main threat to this species, global climate change resulting in warming seawater temperatures, is expected to continue and perhaps worsen, in the near future.&#160;Populations can recover from the mortality events through recruitment of new individuals to existing colonies and the establishment of new colonies, however the recruitment rate for this long-lived species is extremely low and not able to compensate for the increasing mortality rates.&#160;Within a three generation length that includes the past and present, it is inferred that the population will decline by at least 55% to perhaps as high as 80%, as has been documented in the banks at the Columbretes Island. Although these declines nearly reach the threshold for Critically Endangered, the non-reef forming colonies throughout the Mediterranean Sea are persisting at present levels of mortality. Therefore, this species is assessed as Endangered under criterion A4a.</p><p>Continuous monitoring of the species populations is highly recommended. This species should be re-evaluated in five years to include additional information and to determine the effects of continued or increased threats from climate change and direct anthropogenic impacts.</p>","<p><em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> can be considered as part of the recent fossil history of the Mediterranean Sea. Since the Pliocene <em>C. caespitosa</em> has been the only species that develops monospecific reef-like structures in the Mediterranean Basin. The oldest fossil records of banks of <em>C. caespitosa</em> are those described by Aguirre and Jiménez (1998) from the Upper Pliocene shallow marine deposit of the Almería-Nijar basin (southeastern Spain). This coral species became very common in some Quaternary peri-Mediterranean basins and diverse Holocene and Pleistocene fossil banks have been described from several areas (e.g., Cuerda <em>et al.</em> 1986, Fornós <em>et al.</em> 1996, Kühlmann 1996, Bernasconi <em>et al.</em> 1997). Furthermore, Laborel (1987) mentioned the existence of extensive dead banks of <em>C. caespitosa </em>(dated around 2500-3000 years ago) on the coasts of Tunisia and Corsica.  </p>  <p>The currently known <em>Cladocora caespitosa </em>distribution range covers the entire Mediterranean Basin and adjacent areas of the Atlantic including Olhao in Portugal and Agadir in Morocco (Zibrowius 1983, Schiller 1993). Despite the extensive distribution of dispersed colonies,  only in a few locations do the colonies form beds (i.e., great numbers of distinct subspherical colonies 10–30 cm in diameter) or banks (i.e., large formations reaching several decimeters in height and covering several square meters in surface area) (Peirano <em>et al</em>. 1999). Living banks and/or beds of this coral have been recorded in: Tunisia (Zibrowius 1980); the Gulf of Atalanti and some places of the Aegean Sea (Laborel 1987); the Gulf of La Spezia, Ligurian coasts  (<span lang=""en-GB"">Morri <em>et al</em>. 2000, Peirano <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2005, Rodolfo-Metalpa <em>et al</em>. 2005);<span lang=""en-GB""> in the Adriatic Sea: in Mljet National Park, other localities of the Croatian and Slovenian coasts (Schiller 1993, Kružić and Pozar-Domac 2002, Kružić and Benkovic 2008) and in the Bay of Piran (Schiller 1993); the northwestern Mediterranean: the Columbretes Islands, Medes Islands and Cap de Creus (Kersting and Linares 2012); the Levantine Sea, Cyprus (Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2014);&#160;the Marmara&#160;and northern Aegean&#160;Sea, Turkey (Öztürk&#160; 2004, Özalp and Alparslan 2011).&#160;Large spreading banks of the species have also been found in the Balearic Islands, in the localities of&#160;Minorca (Fayos pers. comm. 2014) and Mallorca (Cap Blanc (R.

On the other hand, the genetic connectivity among the populations seems to be related to sporadic dispersal events.

This climate-induced necrosis has been recorded over nine summers from 2003 to 2012, in two mortality periods (2003-2006 and 2008-2012). The first mortality period and especially the summer of 2003 triggered high necrosis values in this population, while impacts over the second period were milder. This shows that extreme hot summers such as in 2003 have a significant impact on this population. Furthermore, the summer of 2003 had delayed effects in the following summers resulting in an increase in the recorded necrosis rates, even if seawater temperature showed mild thermal anomalies (Kersting <em>et al.</em> 2013b). Given these results and the<span lang=""en-GB""> increase in frequency and persistence of extreme events projected for the 21</span><sup><span lang=""en-GB"">st</sup><span lang=""en-GB"">  century in the Mediterranean Sea (Déqué 2007, Diffenbaugh <em>et al</em>. 2007), recurrent mortality episodes could likely be repeated and will threaten this species, which, due to its slow dynamics, will most likely not be able to cope with elevated mortality rates (Kersting <em>et al</em>. 2014b).</span></p> <p> This population  is also being impacted by two invasive algae (<em>Caulerpa racemosa</em> and <em>Lophocladia lallemandii</em>). Even if no lethal effects of these algae have been detected on <em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> in Columbretes,  sublethal effects derived of the algal invasion on other stages of the life cycle of <em>C. caespitosa</em>, like recruitment and juvenile survival, cannot be disregarded (Kersting <em>et al</em>. 2014a).  </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Populations of </strong><em><strong>Cladocora caespitosa</strong></em><strong> in the Adriatic Sea</strong></p> <p><u>Size</u>&#160;The most extensive population of the species occurs in Veliko Jezero (Mljet National Park, southern Adriatic) at 6-18 m depth, where the bank has a large coverage of 650 m<sup>2</sup> (Kružić and Pozar-Domac 2003). Average coral growth rate has been estimated on a range of 1.92-4.19 mm/ year; and the age of the banks has been estimated to be 46-312 years (Kružić and Pozar-Domac 2002).</p> <p>Three other banks of the species have been described in the Adriatic Sea. The banks close to&#160;Prvić&#160;Island (Kvarner region, N Adriatic Sea) occur between 11-19 m depth and cover a size of about 190 m<sup>2</sup>. Its average growth rate has been estimated in 3.08 mm/year, and the age of the bank estimated at 194 years. The bank near Pag Island (central Adriatic), occurs between 15-21 m depth and covers 120 m<sup>2</sup>. Its average coral growth rate has been estimated in 3.06 mm/ year and age estimated of the bank in 294 years. (Kružić and Benković 2008). More recently, a bank near Iz Island (central Adriatic) has been described, occurring between 12-16 m depth and covering an area of 150 m<sup>2</sup> (Kružić and Požar-Domac 2007). </p>  <p><u>Population trends</u>&#160;Anthropogenic activities such as industrial and sewage discharges, trawling and other, fishing activities and coastal works  development have caused a major decline of <em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> in the eastern Adriatic Sea during the last decades. A negative correlation has been observed in this populations between sea surface temperature and coral carbonate density (Kružić <em>et al.</em> 2012), that would mean an attenuation of calcification probably due to an inhibition of the photosynthetic process carried out by zooxanthellate at higher temperatures.</p> <p>During 1954-1958 high input of phosphates into the seawater decreased coral growth on the Mljet coral bank in the Veliko Jezero Lake. This event was related to the experimental fertilization of Mljet’s Veliko Jezero Lake in 1953, in which, around 17 tons of phosphates (117 kg/hectare) were discharged into the lake. </p> <p> During the summers 1997 and 1998, the increased temperatures caused polyp necrosis in 10% colonies at the Mljet bank (Kružić <em>et al.</em> 2012)</p> <p>During 2001-2005 more than 90% of <em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> colonies from the bank near Iz Island died in the vicinity of tuna farms. This might be due the increase on nitrites and nitrates concentrations. This increase in nutrients enhanced phytoplankton and macroalgal blooms, thus decreasing the light available for the benthic communities. Increased levels of nutrients also led to higher levels of filamentous algae. </p> <p><strong>Populations of <em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> from the Marmara Sea</strong></p><p><u>Size</u>&#160;Populations in the Dardanelles and Marmara Sea are formed by beds of colonies varying from 8-96 cm diameter. The colonies occur at 2-23 m depth and the total spreading area that colonies covered in Dardanos region is 27 m<sup>2</sup>. In Soğandere region the total area is 3 m<sup>2</sup>. The total coverage for the other areas is less than 2 m<sup>2</sup>. In the Dardanelles (Marmara Sea) there are many individual <em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> colonies, not forming a large coral bank. Unlike colonies found in the Mediterranean sea, colonies in this area are not closely ordered and the formation could not be considered as a big bank reef of <em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> (Özalp 2013).</p><p><u>Population trends</u>&#160;According to the latest observations performed in the late 2013 (B.&#160;Özalp&#160;pers. obs.), the necrosed extent of the colonies is about 50% of the colony area. It is thought that the physico-chemical conditions and the seasonal abnormal changes have an effect on this problem. Although short-term surveys show an increase in bleaching, more extensive scientific investigation focusing on population dynamics and colony condition and regular monitoring of ecological features need to be undertaken in the coming years.</p><p><strong>Other relevant information from smaller populations of <em>Cladocora caespitosa</em></strong></p><p>Beds of <em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> have been also found in the Gulf of La Spezia (northern Tyrrhenian Sea) in the localities of Fiascherino Bay, Punta Bianca and Bocca di Magra. Beds of the species are mainly formed by colonies within a range of 20-65 cm in diameter (Periano <em>et al.</em> 1999). Colonies from this population have been found to range from 9-63 years old. A bank of <em>Cladocora caespitosa </em>has been recorded in the Gulf of La Spezia (Morri <em>et al</em>. 2000) however with no population information available. A three years monitoring study of the colonies at Fiascherino&#160;Bay during period 1997-1999 period showed at the end of the study about 50% of the colonies completely dead (Rodolfo-Metalpa <em>et al</em>. 2005), associated with an increase on seawater temperature during the summer period. </p><p>Monitoring studies of <em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> populations in Cyprus have shown that some beds have been heavily impacted by warming events in 2010 and 2012, with a high percentage of necrosed colonies (Jimenez pers. comm. 2014).</p><p>Populations of <em>C. caespitosa</em> around Medes  Islands and Cap de Creus (NW Mediterranean Sea), comprise disperse colonies, and are not currently impacted by climate-induced mortality and invasive species. However, it is important to note that they are found at deeper waters, below 20-25 m depth, where the incidence of these and other impacts is lower and the recorded mortality of the colonies is almost nil (Kersting and Linares pers. comm. 2014).</p><p>Large spreading banks of the species have been found in the Balearic Islands, in the localities of Cala Galdana (Minorca; at 5-10 m depth, Fayos pers. comm.) and Cap Blanc (Mallorca, 36 m depth, R.

The capacity of the species to tolerate a range of environments and to withstand seasonal abiotic factors such as temperature and light, typical of temperate seas as the <a>Mediterranean,</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;is probably related to the ability of this species to regulate autotrophy and heterotrophy depending on the environmental light conditions, as suggested by Hoogenboom <em>et al</em>. (2010).</p><p><em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> may occur in a wide range of habitats, from shallow photophilic communities to circalitoral assemblages, however, the equilibrium between hydrodynamic protection and high water exchange through strong currents seems to enhance the development of extensive <em>C. caespitosa</em> populations, as occurs in the Mjlet National Park and Columbretes Islands (Kružić and Benkovic 2008, Kesting and Linares 2012).</p><p>The high prevalence of macroalgae has been considered a limiting factor in the development of this coral (e.g., Peirano <em>et al. </em>1998, Rodolfo-Metalpa <em>et al</em>. 1999). However, the coral has been shown to be able to successfully compete with those algae in some localities, as happens in the Illa Grossa Bay where algal cover is high and most of the coral colonies and banks occur within the infralitoral photophilic algal community (Kersting and Linares 2012, Kersting 2013); whilst in other localities such the&#160;Adriatic and Marmara seas, the presence of algae (mainly <em>C. racemosa</em>) has been observed to impact the growth of the species&#160;(B.

Spawning has been observed to occur coinciding with increasing Summer water temperature and correlated with the lunar cycle. Eggs are released by the polyps in a mucus coating as clumps of eggs, that binds them together, while sperm are freely released (Kružic <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the western Mediterranean, histological analyses have shown that the coral is gonochoric (Kersting <em>et al</em>. 2013c). Spawning time has been observed to differ significantly between the Adriatic Sea and the western Mediterranean; in the former, spawning was observed at the beginning of Summer, coinciding with rising sea water temperatures (Kružic <em>et al</em>. 2008), whilst in the western Mediterranean spawning seems to occur at the end of the Summer coinciding with the cooling of sea water temperature (Kersting <em>et al</em>. 2013c). <a></a><a>These notable differences on reproductive biology between these two regions should be further investigated.</a></p>  <p><a><span style="""">Based on average sizes and growth rates of the species, we assume </span>that average generation length is 30 years<span style="""">.&#160;Average&#160;longevity is not known, but likely to be more than 100 </span></a><a>years.</a>&#160;In the Adriatic Sea and Columbretes Islands, colonies of already 300 years have been described.</p>","<p><em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> is a long-lived species showing slow dynamics, therefore being highly limited in its capability of recovery from impacts of diverse nature (Kersting <em>et al. </em>2014b).</p><p><em>Cladocora caespitosa</em> mass mortalities related to seawater warming and summer heat waves have been reported in several Mediterranean sites (Perez <em>et al</em>. 2000, Rodolfo-Metalpa <em>et al.</em> 2005, Garrabou <em>et al.</em> 2009, Kružić <em>et al</em>. 2012, Kersting <em>et al</em>. 2013b, Hadjioannou pers. comm. 2015).

This species is susceptible to bleaching and is sometimes harvested for the curio and jewellery trade, and it has suffered reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown, but population reduction can be inferred from declines in habitat quality based on estimates of destroyed reefs within its range (Wilkinson 2004). The estimated habitat degradation and loss of 12% over three generation lengths (30 years) is the best inference of population reduction and does not meet any of the thresholds for threatened categories. It is listed as Least Concern. It will be important to reassess this species in 10 years time because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification.","This species has a restricted distribution in the Caribbean. All references to it outside of the southeastern Caribbean are likely misidentifications of a growth form of <em>M. complanata</em> (Fenner, pers. comm.).","This is the most restricted of the Caribbean <em>Millepora</em> species.

But has not been reported from Florida, the Bahamas, or the northern or western Caribbean (Humann and DeLoach 2006).<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species. However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is more resilient to some of the threats faced by corals and therefore population decline is estimated using the percentage of destroyed reefs only (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage of destroyed reefs. Reef losses throughout the species' range have been estimated over three generations, two in the past and one projected into the future.<br/><br/>The age of first maturity of most reef building corals is typically three to eight years (Wallace 1999) and therefore we assume that average age of mature individuals is greater than eight years. Furthermore, based on average sizes and growth rates, we assume that average generation length is 10 years, unless otherwise stated. Total longevity is not known, but likely to be more than ten years.

This genus is generally susceptible to bleaching. They are some of the first hard corals to bleach but are resilient, being some of the first to recruit after the bleaching. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification. In addition to global climate change, corals are also threatened by disease, and a number of localized threats. The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and is a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and uncommon throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 22% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

However, this species is reasonably widespread, and  is often a conspicuous survivor on reef tops following disturbances, including bleaching.

According to Glynn <em>et al</em>.(1988), pocilloporid coral mortality in the eastern Pacific was high, ranging from 51% at Caño Island to 76-85% in Panama and 97-100% in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1988). <br/><br/>Glynn (1994) suggests that the sea urchin <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (syn. <em>E. thouarsii</em>) provides important biotic control of pocilloporid reef development. This urchin is the most persistent corallivore in the Galapagos Islands, where it is often observed grazing on pocilloporid corals (Glynn 2001). <br/><br/>In the Eastern Tropical Pacific, overfishing is probably responsible for some ecological imbalance on coral reefs that could prolong recovery from other disturbances (Glynn 2001). Moreover, Edgar <em>et al</em>.(unpublished manuscript) reported that over-exploitation of sea urchin predators (lobsters and fishes), along with ENSO, has a major effect in the condition and distribution of corals in the Galapagos Islands, by increasing the grazer and bioerosion pressure on corals. <br/><br/>Coral mortality associated with phytoplankton blooms has been reported from Caño Island, Costa Rica, and Uva Island, Panama, in 1985; where mortality of pocilloporid species (especially <em>P. capitata</em> and <em>P. elegans</em>) was in the order of 100% and 13% respectively at 3m depth (Guzmán <em>et al</em>. 1990).<br/><br/>According to Glynn (2001), pocilloporid coral harvesting is an important threat in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, specially along the continental coast. This activity has virtually eliminated pocilloporid corals from Acapulco (Mexico), Bahia Culebra (Costa Rica), Taboga Island (Panama), and parts of the coast of Ecuador (Glynn 2001). Nevertheless, this activity is now largely excluded from Costa Rica and Panama (Guzmán pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Bryant <em>et al</em>. (1998), based on four anthropogenic factors (coastal development; overexploitation and destructive fishing practice; inland pollution and erosion, and marine pollution), estimated a high threat to coral reefs along the coasts of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. High levels of siltation caused by accelerated coastal erosion have degraded coral reefs in Costa Rica, Colombia and Ecuador (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/>Other threats include: a) predation principally by <em>Acanthaster</em> and <em>Jenneria</em> (Glynn 2002, 1994, 2000), and b) harvesting for the curio trade, an activity that has virtually eliminated pocilloporid corals from Acapulco (Mexico), Bahia Culebra (Costa Rica), Taboga Island (Panama), and parts of the coast of Ecuador (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II.

Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1994) suggested that eastern Pacific populations appeared to be reproductively active over multiple annual intervals, including periods of relatively low temperature. According to Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1994), fecundity can vary between regions; <em>P. lobata</em> has higher fecundities at Caño Island, Costa Rica, and Uva Island, Panama, than in the Galápagos Islands, where water temperatures are lower and more seasonally variable. Moreover, Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1994) suggest that <em>P. lobata</em> reproduces twice per year in thermally high and stable environments. Fecundity of this coral appears to benefit from moderate sea warming events, but may decline dramatically during unusually strong thermal anomalies (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994). After 1983, observations of sexual recruitment have been rare to infrequent in the eastern Pacific; however sexual recruitment has been observed in some areas of the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994). The almost complete absence of sexual recruitment for this species in the eastern Pacific may be due to high larval mortality in the water column; as well as increased levels of competition with benthic alga, and increased densities of grazers and bioeroders following the 1982-83 El Niño event (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/><em>Porites lobata</em> can also reproduce asexually by fragmentation (Guzmán and Cortés 1989, Cortés and Guzmán 1998, Cortés and Jiménez 2003). In the eastern Pacific the incidental feeding activities of the triggerfish <em>Pseudobalistes naufragium</em> can generate fragments that survive to form new colonies (Guzmán and Cortés 1989, Cortés and Guzmán 1998, Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994). This form of fragmentation is common in Costa Rica and Panama, but uncommon in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994). Fragmentation also occurs by initial weakening of colonies by bioeroders; <em>P. lobata</em> colonies possess high densities of boring bivalves (<em>Lithophaga</em> spp.), which erode the skeletal structure, a process that can also lead to fragmentation (Cortés and Jiménez 2003, Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>At least eight fish species feed on live corals, with their feeding strategies ranging from removing mainly live tissue and causing little damage to the skeleton, to abrading or breaking apart colonies in the feeding process, such as during feeding of <em>Arothron meleagris</em> and <em>Pseudobalistes naufragium</em> (Guzmán and Cortes 1989, Glynn 2001). <em>Porites lobata</em> is commonly grazed by the puffer <em>Arothron meleagris</em> (Guzmán and Robertson 1989, Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994).","In the Eastern Tropical Pacific, <em>Porites lobata</em> was greatly affected by the 1982-83 El Niño event (Guzmán pers. comm.) at Caño Island, Costa Rica, where live cover declined by about 68% (Guzmán <em>et al</em>. 1987). Populations were even more reduced in Cocos Island (to 3%) (Guzmán and Cortes 1992), but had recovered after 20 years (Guzmán and Cortes 2006). High mortalities (95-100%) were also reported in the Galápagos from many sites (e.g., San Cristobal and Santa Cruz), and high partial mortality (&lt;1-18% live tissue remaining) was found at most sites (Glynn 1990, Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1994). <br/><br/>In the Indo-Pacific, this species exhibited moderate bleaching and mortality (10-40%) in the 1998 bleaching event in Palau (Brunno <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/><em>Porites</em> is heavily collected for the aquarium trade. In Indonesia, the catch quota for this genus is 55,500 per year; annual collection quota for <em>P. lobata</em> is 3,000 (Terangi Indonesian Coral Reef Foundation, unpublished data).<br/><br/>The genus is not particularly susceptible to bleaching, but is more prone to disease than many other corals.

In addition to global climate change, corals are also threatened by  a number of localized threats. Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities.

Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

(1988) report high rates of pocilloporid coral mortality across the eastern Pacific following the 1982/83 El Niño, ranging from 51% at Caño Island to 76-85% in Panama and 97-100% in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1988). However, following this high coral mortality, numerous pocilloporid recruits have been observed at some sites in Costa Rica, Panama and the Galápagos Islands (Glynn unpublished data in Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). According to Cortés and Guzmán (pers. comm.), Pocillopora damicornis seems to be very abundant and recovering in Panama, Costa Rica and Colombia, despite severe coral mortality after the ENSO events (1982-83 and 1997-98).<br/><br/>In the Galápagos Islands, pocilloporid communities were well developed off northeastern San Cristobal, Espanola and Floreana Island until the 1980s (Glynn 1994, 2003), but disappeared following the 1982-83 ENSO event, with minimal coral recruitment since (Glynn 2003). No live <em>Pocillopora damicornis</em> has been seen in the once coral-filled lava rock pools at Punta Espinosa, Fernandina, Galápagos Islands since 1983 (Glynn 2003).<br/><br/>In mainland Ecuador at Sucre Island, Machalilla, the predominant frame-building species before 1983 were <em>Pocillopora elegans</em> and <em>Pocillopora damicornis</em>, with the two species generating a rigid framework that covered over 1 ha of bottom (Glynn 2003). However, by 1991 the reef had declined to dispersed colonies of <em>P. damicornis</em> and <em>P. elegans</em> (Glynn 2003).<br/><br/>There is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is more resilient to some of the threats faced by corals and therefore population decline is estimated using the percentage of destroyed reefs only (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage of destroyed reefs. Reef losses throughout the species' range have been estimated over three generations, two in the past and one projected into the future.<br/><br/>The age of first maturity of most reef building corals is typically three to eight years (Wallace 1999) and therefore we assume that average age of mature individuals is greater than eight years. Furthermore, based on average sizes and growth rates, we assume that average generation length is 10 years, unless otherwise stated. Total longevity is not known, but likely to be more than ten years.

This species is found in mono-specific stands or multi-species reefs throughout its range from near the surface to a maximum depth of 20 m. It is commonly found from 1-15 m, rarely 18-20 m, in the South China Sea and Gulf of Siam. (Titlyanov and Titlyanova 2002) This species is considered to be a main reef-framework builder and is found from 0.5-6 m of Panama (Sheppard 1982). This species is relatively tolerant of sedimentation and low salinity as long as there is adequate water motion. Colonies reproduce by fragmentation and by sexual reproduction (broadcast spawning) (Hodgson 1998).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Tropical Pacific region the species has not been reported from mangrove environments (Cortés and Guzmán pers. comm.) but it is one of the major reef building species, forming intermeshing compact frameworks that can attain 2-3 m in relief (Glynn 2001). Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the fastest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortés 1993). Reported growth rates of <em>Pocillopora damicornis</em> vary substantially between locations in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, from 1.27 cm per year in Colombia to 3.96 cm per year in Panama (Guzmán and Cortes 1993).<br/><br/>Pocilloporid corals, presumably including <em>P. damicornis</em>, are generally amongst the strongest coral competitors with relatively high rates of calcification (Glynn 2001). However, coral species exhibiting high rates of calcification usually have relatively high mortality rates (Glynn 2000). Pocilloporid corals also usually predominate at shallow depths (1-15m). Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the highest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortes 1993). They are the principal framework builders on Panamanian reefs (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/><em>P. damicornis</em> is a broadcast spawner (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991) with the capacity to function as a simultaneous hermaphrodite (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1991), larval settlement in the Galápagos Islands presumably has been the predominant mode of recruitment, and the only observed form of recruitment in areas that experienced high mortality (97-100%) in 1983. Asexual reproduction by fragmentation has been reported as an important mechanism for reef recovery in Panama (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). <em>P. damicornis</em>, like other pocilloporid species in the eastern Pacific, has low rates of recruitment (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Histological evidence indicates that spawning is likely to occur during a few days around the new moon (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Reproductive activity in the eastern Pacific its related to local thermal regimes, with a generally higher incidence of gravid corals at sites with stable, warm water conditions, or during warming periods in areas that experience significant seasonal variation (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1991). Glynn <em>et al</em>. (1991) conclude that moderate El Nino warming can stimulate gametogenesis in Galápagos pocilloporid corals.<br/><br/><em>Pocillopora</em> species are preyed on by at least nine groups of consumers. These vary in their consumption patterns, but include:<br/><br/>a) Species that bite off colony branch-tips: pufferfishes (<em>Arothron</em>), parrotfishes (<em>Scaridae</em>), filefishes (Monacanthidae) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>b) Species that scrape skeletal surface: hermit crabs (<em>Trizopagurus</em>, <em>Aniculus</em>, and <em>Calcinus</em>) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>c) Species that remove tissues but leave the skeleton intact: gastropods (<em>Jenneria pustulata</em> and <em>Quoyula</em> sp. (Glynn 2002)), buterflyfishes, angelfishes, damselfish (<em>Stegastes acapulcoensis</em>), and <em>Acanthaster planci</em> (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>d) Species that abrade tissues and skeleton: <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/><em>Jenneria</em> and <em>Acanthaster can kill whole, relatively large (approx. 30 cm in diameter) colonies of <em>Pocillopora</em> (Glynn 2002). Pocilloporid species can have crab (<em>Trapezia</em> sp.) and alpheid shrimp as mutualistic symbionts that protect the coral from the attack of the crown-of-thorns sea star <em>A. planci</em> (Glynn 2001).","This is the most commonly harvested species in the area. Like other coral species it is collected to be used directly as construction material, to make lime, which is used to make concrete and to sell as curios. Live corals are collected for sale to the aquarium trade (Hodgson 1998).<br/><br/>This species is targeted for the aquarium trade. Indonesia is the largest exporter with an annual quota of 6,000 live pieces in 2005. The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 15,321.<br/><br/>This species exhibited variable bleaching (0-50%) and low mortality in the 1998 bleaching event in Palau (Brunno <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Pocilloporid species as well as other major reef building corals within the Eastern Tropical Pacific region (<em>Porites</em>, <em>Pavona</em>, <em>Gardinoseris</em>) catastrophically declined in the Galápagos Archipelago and Cocos Island after 1983. Recovery observed since that time was in large part nullified by the 1997-98 ENSO event (Glynn 2000). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>.(1988), pocilloporid coral mortality in the eastern Pacific was high, ranging from 51% at Caño Island to 76-85% in Panama and 97-100% in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1988). <br/><br/>Glynn (1994) suggests that the sea urchin <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (syn. <em>E. thouarsii</em>) provides important biotic control of pocilloporid reef development. This urchin is the most persistent corallivore in the Galapagos Islands, where it is often observed grazing on pocilloporid corals (Glynn 2001). <br/><br/>Overfishing is probably responsible for some ecological imbalance on coral reefs that could prolong recovery from other disturbances (Glynn 2001). Moreover, Edgar et al (unpublished manuscript) reported that over-exploitation of sea urchin predators (lobsters and fishes), along with ENSO, has a major effect in the condition and distribution of corals in the Galapagos Islands, by increasing the grazer and bioerosion pressure on corals. <br/><br/>Coral mortality associated with phytoplankton blooms has been reported from Caño Island, Costa Rica, and Uva Island, Panama, in 1985; where mortality of pocilloporid species (especially <em>P. capitata</em> and <em>P. elegans</em>) was in the order of 100% and 13% respectively at 3m depth (Guzmán <em>et al</em>. 1990).<br/><br/>According to Glynn (2001), pocilloporid coral harvesting is an important threat in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, specially along the continental coast. This activity has virtually eliminated pocilloporid corals from Acapulco (Mexico), Bahia Culebra (Costa Rica), Taboga Island (Panama), and parts of the coast of Ecuador (Glynn 2001). Nevertheless, this activity is now largely excluded from Costa Rica and Panama (Guzmán pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Bryant <em>et al</em>. (1998), based on four anthropogenic factors (coastal development; overexploitation and destructive fishing practice; inland pollution and erosion, and marine pollution), estimated a high threat to coral reefs along the coasts of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. High levels of siltation caused by accelerated coastal erosion have degraded coral reefs in Costa Rica, Colombia and Ecuador (Glynn 2001)<br/><br/>Other threats include: a) predation principally by <em>Acanthaster</em> and <em>Jenneria</em> (Glynn 2002, 1994, 2000), and b) harvesting for the curio trade, an activity that has virtually eliminated pocilloporid corals from Acapulco (Mexico), Bahia Culebra (Costa Rica), Taboga Island (Panama), and parts of the coast of Ecuador (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004).

This species may be found to 15 m depth.<br/><br/>General genus information: throughout its range, <em>Acropora</em> can be found on any stretch of reef and is often the dominant coral, especially along the reef front. Staghorn and plate forms flourish in sheltered areas, whereas clusters and semi-massive types can withstand more exposed conditions. Species that occur from the reef top to the reef slope become gradually more flattened with depth (Wood 1983).","Members of this genus have a low resistance and low tolerance to bleaching and disease, and are slow to recover. <br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon corals of the genus <em>Acropora</em> (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 1282.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II.

The estimated habitat loss of 14% from reefs already destroyed and those at critical stage within its range is the best inference of population reduction (Wilkinson 2004).

If these factors continue they are likely to contribute to survival of northern Red Sea species into the future.  The southern Red Sea did not escape recent bleaching events and the Gulf of Aqaba and the Hurghada regions are affected by numerous direct impacts from coastal development and industry.<br/><br/>Genetics studies have, however, demonstrated the wide degree of differentiation of Red Sea populations from other Indian Ocean and Indo-West Pacific populations, consistent with a low level of gene exchange between the Red Sea and elsewhere. This relative isolation means that recovery following regional scale disturbance that decimates populations in the Red Sea may be compromised. For Red Sea endemics such disturbances would prove catastrophic.","This is an uncommon species.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species.

Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability.

This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 20% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened.

Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. However, this species is extremely widespread in tropical, subtropical habitats, and across a range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming.

Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category.

At seven sites in Las Perlas and 9 sites in the Gulf of Chiriqui (Guzmán <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/><br/>Glynn (1999) indicates that the abundance of pocilloporid species shows marked interannual fluctuation. At three sites in the Galápagos Islands (Cormorant Bay, Floreana; Northeast anchorage, Santa Fe; and Caleta Robinson, Santa Cruz) in surveys undertaken from 1993 to 1997, <em>P. inflata</em> was present during some surveys, but absent after 1 to 3 yr in subsequent surveys (Glynn 1999). <br/><br/>Although <em>Pocillopora inflata</em> is widely distributed in the Galapagos Islands, it has a low relative abundance (1.9 to 16.7% of all pocilloporid corals), as well as very low densities, ranging from 0.2 to 2.5 colonies per ha (Glynn 1999). According to Glynn (1999), this low abundance probably reflects the severe coral mortality (97%) during the 1982-83 ENSO event.

The species is usually found intermixed with other pocilloporid corals in Costa Rica and Panama (Jiménez and Cortés 2003, Guzmán <em>et al</em>. in prep.). <br/><br/>According to Glynn (1999), <em>Pocillopora inflata</em> may have evolved within the eastern Pacific and is presently distributed widely over much of the region. Furthermore, the presence of a large dead colony of <em>P. inflata</em> in the Galápagos Urvina Bay uplift, where a coral community was elevated during a volcano eruption in 1954, indicates that <em>P. inflata</em> is not a recent ENSO-associated immigrant from the Indo-West Pacific; this species has been present in the Galápagos Islands for more than four decades (Glynn 1999).<br/><br/>Amongst the reef building corals in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, pocilloporid species have the fastest growth rates (Guzmán and Cortes 1993). The growth rates of Pocillopora inflata range between 2.0 and 4.4 cm per year, with a mean growth rate of 3.15 cm per year at Bahia Culebra Costa Rica (Jiménez and Cortés 2003, Cortés and Jiménez 2003b). <br/><br/><em>Pocillopora inflata</em> is the only pocilloporid coral observed to spawn (Glynn 1999). The spawning event occurred on the morning (07:30 and 10:30 hours) of 22 March 1998 in Saboga Island, Panama (Glynn 1999). Among the six observed colonies, one spawned eggs and five produced sperm (Glynn 1999). <br/><br/>Pocilloporid corals, presumably including <em>P. inflata</em>, are generally amongst the strongest coral competitors with relatively high rates of calcification (Glynn 2001). However, coral species exhibiting high rates of calcification usually have relatively high mortality rates (Glynn 2000). Pocilloporid corals also usually predominate at shallow depths (1-15 m). <br/><br/><em>Pocillopora</em> species are preyed on by at least nine groups of consumers. These vary in their consumption patterns, but include:<br/><br/>a) Species that bite off colony branch-tips: pufferfishes (<em>Arothron</em>), parrotfishes (<em>Scaridae</em>), filefishes (Monacanthidae) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>b) Species that scrape skeletal surface: hermit crabs (<em>Trizopagurus</em>, <em>Aniculus</em>, and <em>Calcinus</em>) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>c) Species that remove tissues but leave the skeleton intact: gastropods (<em>Jenneria pustulata</em> and <em>Quoyula</em> sp. (Glynn 2002)), buterflyfishes, angelfishes, damselfish (<em>Stegastes acapulcoensis</em>), and <em>Acanthaster planci</em> (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>d) Species that abrade tissues and skeleton: <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/><em>Jenneria</em> and <em>Acanthaster can kill whole, relatively large (approx. 30 cm in diameter) colonies of <em>Pocillopora</em> (Glynn 2002). Pocilloporid species can have crab (<em>Trapezia</em> sp.) and alpheid shrimp as mutualistic symbionts that protect the coral from the attack of the crown-of-thorns sea star <em>A. planci</em> (Glynn 2001).","Pocilloporid species as well as other major reef building corals within the Eastern Tropical Pacific region (<em>Porites</em>, <em>Pavona</em>, <em>Gardinoseris</em>) catastrophically declined in the Galápagos Archipelago and Cocos Island after 1983. Recovery observed since that time was in large part nullified by the 1997-98 ENSO event (Glynn 2000). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>.(1988), pocilloporid coral mortality in the eastern Pacific was high, ranging from 51% at Caño Island to 76-85% in Panama and 97-100% in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn et al 1988). <br/><br/>Glynn (1994) suggests that the sea urchin <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (syn. <em>E. thouarsii</em>) provides important biotic control of pocilloporid reef development. This urchin is the most persistent corallivore in the Galapagos Islands, where it is often observed grazing on pocilloporid corals (Glynn 2001). <br/><br/>Overfishing is probably responsible for some ecological imbalance on coral reefs that could prolong recovery from other disturbances (Glynn 2001). Moreover, Edgar <em>et al.</em> (unpublished manuscript) reported that over-exploitation of sea urchin predators (lobsters and fishes), along with ENSO, has a major effect in the condition and distribution of corals in the Galapagos Islands, by increasing the grazer and bioerosion pressure on corals. <br/><br/>Coral mortality associated with phytoplankton blooms has been reported from Caño Island, Costa Rica, and Uva Island, Panama, in 1985; where mortality of pocilloporid species (especially <em>P. capitata</em> and <em>P. elegans</em>) was in the order of 100% and 13% respectively at 3 m depth (Guzmán<em> et al.</em> 1990).<br/><br/>According to Glynn (2001), pocilloporid coral harvesting is an important threat in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, especially along the continental coast. This activity has virtually eliminated pocilloporid corals from Acapulco (Mexico), Bahia Culebra (Costa Rica), Taboga Island (Panama), and parts of the coast of Ecuador (Glynn 2001). Nevertheless, this activity is now largely excluded from Costa Rica and Panama (Guzmán pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Bryant <em>et al.&#160;</em>(1998), based on four anthropogenic factors (coastal development; overexploitation and destructive fishing practice; inland pollution and erosion, and marine pollution), estimated a high threat to coral reefs along the coasts of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. High levels of siltation caused by accelerated coastal erosion have degraded coral reefs in Costa Rica, Colombia and Ecuador (Glynn 2001)<br/><br/>Other threats include: a) predation principally by <em>Acanthaster</em> and <em>Jenneria</em> (Glynn 2002, 1994, 2000), and b) harvesting for the curio trade, an activity that has virtually eliminated pocilloporid corals from Acapulco (Mexico), Bahia Culebra (Costa Rica), Taboga Island (Panama), and parts of the coast of Ecuador (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004).

It is particularly susceptible to disease, crown-of-thorns starfish predation and extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. However, its distribution is in areas where reefs have not suffered as serious declines as in other regions. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from declines in habitat quality based on the combined estimates of both destroyed reefs and reefs at the critical stage of degradation within its range (Wilkinson 2004). Its threat susceptibility increases the likelihood of being lost within one generation in the future from reefs at a critical stage. The estimated habitat degradation and loss of 22% over three generation lengths (30 years) is the best inference of population reduction and does not meet the threshold any threatened category and therefore is listed as Least Concern. It will be important to reassess this species in 10 years time because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification.","This species is found in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, as well as the south-west Indian Ocean. Also found in Madagascar (Fenner pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The northern Red Sea from Rabigh to the Sinai Peninsula escaped most of the bleaching and the mortality of the last couple of decades. Destroyed and critical reefs are only 6% of the total (Wilkinson 2004) because of its high latitude and very deep water extending close to shore, and wind induced upwelling. If these factors continue they are likely to contribute to survival of northern Red Sea species into the future.  The southern Red Sea did not escape recent bleaching events and the Gulf of Aqaba and the Hurghada regions are affected by numerous direct impacts from coastal development and industry.<br/><br/>Genetics studies have, however, demonstrated the wide degree of differentiation of Red Sea populations from other Indian Ocean and Indo-West Pacific populations, consistent with a low level of gene exchange between the Red Sea and elsewhere. This relative isolation means that recovery following regional scale disturbance that decimates populations in the Red Sea may be compromised. For Red Sea endemics such disturbances would prove catastrophic.","This is an uncommon species.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species.

Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).

Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).

These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

However, this species is extremely widespread in tropical, subtropical habitats, and across a wide range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987).Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces. The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 0. <br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II.

The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and is a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the Great Barrier Reef were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities.","All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 10% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category and this species is Least Concern.

133604,133604,NA,"This species has a disjunct distribution and is found in the southern Red Sea, the Arabian Gulfs and northern Madagascar. It is locally common. It is particularly susceptible to bleaching, disease, crown-of-thorns starfish predation and extensive reduction of coral reef habitat due to a combination of threats. Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from declines in habitat quality based on the combined estimates of both destroyed reefs and reefs at the critical stage of degradation within its range (Wilkinson 2004). Its threat susceptibility increases the likelihood of being lost within one generation in the future from reefs at a critical stage. Therefore, the estimated habitat degradation and loss of 28% over three generation lengths (30 years) is the best inference of population reduction. As it is very close to meeting the threshold for a threatened category it is listed as Near Threatened. It will be important to reassess this species in 10 years time because of predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification. <br/><br/>This species was described originally from the Persian Gulf and subsequently recorded from the Red Sea and western Indian Ocean. There is some question about the validity of the records outside of the Persian Gulf. If this species is restricted to the Persian Gulf then the estimate of population decline would increase dramatically to approximately 80% and therefore would qualify for the category Critically Endangered.","This species occurs in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, northwest Indian Ocean, the Arabian/Iranian Gulf, and the northern Indian Ocean and in the northern part of Madagascar.

There is some question about the validity of the records outside of the Persian Gulf. <br/><br/><strong>Red Sea</strong><br/>The northern Red Sea from Rabigh to the Sinai Peninsula escaped most of the bleaching and the mortality of the last couple of decades. Destroyed and critical reefs are only 6% of the total (Wilkinson, 2004) because of its high latitude and very deep water extending close to shore, and wind induced upwelling. If these factors continue they are likely to contribute to survival of northern Red Sea species into the future.  The southern Red Sea did not escape recent bleaching events and the Gulf of Aqaba and the Hurghada regions are affected by numerous direct impacts from coastal development and industry.<br/><br/>Genetics studies have, however, demonstrated the wide degree of differentiation of Red Sea populations from other Indian Ocean and Indo-West Pacific populations, consistent with a low level of gene exchange between the Red Sea and elsewhere. This relative isolation means that recovery following regional scale disturbance that decimates populations in the Red Sea may be compromised. For Red Sea endemics such disturbances would prove catastrophic.","This species is locally common.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species.

Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It is widespread and common throughout its range and therefore is likely to be more resilient to habitat loss and reef degradation because of an assumed large effective population size that is highly connected and/or stable with enhanced genetic variability. Therefore, the estimated habitat loss of 19% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened. Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","This species is found from Southwest Madagascar, Rodrigues, Andaman Sea, Southeast Asia, southern Japan, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Fiji, American Samoa, Line Islands, Hawaii, and Johnston Atoll.","This species is common in the north and central Pacific, but is uncommon elsewhere.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species.

Bleaching events, leading to coral mortality, are predicted to become more frequent and severe. Species in the genus <em>Montipora</em> are susceptible to bleaching. Species in the genus tend to be quite fast growing and reproduce asexually by fragmentation, so if they can re-establish after mortality, they can recover fast.<br/><br/><em>Acanthaster planci</em>, the crown-of-thorns starfish, has been observed preferentially preying upon members of this genus (Colgan 1987). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region.

Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","In the Indo-West Pacific, this species is found in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, and the Gulf of Kutch.<br/><br/>The northern Red Sea from Rabigh to the Sinai Peninsula escaped most of the bleaching and the mortality of the last couple of decades. Destroyed and critical reefs are only 6% of the total (Wilkinson 2004) because of its high latitude and very deep water extending close to shore, and wind induced upwelling. If these factors continue they are likely to contribute to survival of northern Red Sea species into the future.  The southern Red Sea did not escape recent bleaching events and the Gulf of Aqaba and the Hurghada regions are affected by numerous direct impacts from coastal development and industry.<br/><br/>Genetics studies have, however, demonstrated the wide degree of differentiation of Red Sea populations from other Indian Ocean and Indo-West Pacific populations, consistent with a low level of gene exchange between the Red Sea and elsewhere. This relative isolation means that recovery following regional scale disturbance that decimates populations in the Red Sea may be compromised. For Red Sea endemics such disturbances would prove catastrophic.","This is a reasonably common species in the northern Red Sea, but perhaps rarer elsewhere.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species. However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species.

Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) are found throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Red Sea. These starfish are voracious predators of reef-building corals, with a preference for branching and tabular corals such as <em>Acropora</em> species. Populations of the crown-of-thorns starfish have greatly increased since the 1970s and have been known to wipe out large areas of coral reef habitat. Increased breakouts of COTS has become a major threat to some species, and have contributed to the overall decline and reef destruction in the Indo-Pacific region. The effects of such an outbreak include the reduction of abundance and surface cover of living coral, reduction of species diversity and composition, and overall reduction in habitat area. <br/><br/>The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 4,646. Indonesia is the largest exporter with an annual quota of 1,700 live pieces in 2005. In 2006 the Indonesia export quota for all <em>Montipora</em> species was 19,200 pieces. However, this is an encrusting to sub-massive species that is probably not significantly impacted by harvest.<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006).  Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II.

Specific population trends are unknown but population reduction can be inferred from estimated habitat loss (Wilkinson 2004). It has a relatively small range and is found to be rare. The estimated habitat loss of 18% from reefs already destroyed within its range is the best inference of population reduction since it may survive in coral reefs already at the critical stage of degradation (Wilkinson 2004). This inference of population reduction over three generation lengths (30 years) does not meet the threshold of a threat category. However, since this population reduction estimate is close to a threatened threshold, and because this species is moderately susceptible to a number of threats, it is likely to be one of the species lost on some reefs currently at the critical stage of degradation and therefore is Near Threatened. Predicted threats from climate change and ocean acidification make it important to reassess this species in 10 years or sooner, particularly if the species is actually observed to disappear from reefs currently at the critical stage of reef degradation.","In the Indo-West Pacific, this species is found in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and northern Madagascar. It might be found to occur more widely.<br/><br/>The northern Red Sea from Rabigh to the Sinai Peninsula escaped most of the bleaching and the mortality of the last couple of decades. Destroyed and critical reefs are only 6% of the total (Wilkinson 2004) because of its high latitude and very deep water extending close to shore, and wind induced upwelling. If these factors continue they are likely to contribute to survival of northern Red Sea species into the future. The southern Red Sea did not escape recent bleaching events and the Gulf of Aqaba and the Hurghada regions are affected by numerous direct impacts from coastal development and industry.<br/><br/>Genetics studies have, however, demonstrated the wide degree of differentiation of Red Sea populations from other Indian Ocean and Indo-West Pacific populations, consistent with a low level of gene exchange between the Red Sea and elsewhere. This relative isolation means that recovery following regional scale disturbance that decimates populations in the Red Sea may be compromised. For Red Sea endemics such disturbances would prove catastrophic.","This is a rare species.<br/><br/>There is no species specific population information available for this species. However, there is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species.

However, this species is extremely widespread in tropical, subtropical habitats, and across a range of depths, providing a possible degree of resilience to threats relating to global warming.

These vary in their consumption patterns, but include:<br/><br/>a) Species that bite off colony branch-tips: pufferfishes (<em>Arothron</em>), parrotfishes (<em>Scaridae</em>), filefishes (Monacanthidae) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>b) Species that scrape skeletal surface: hermit crabs (<em>Trizopagurus</em>, <em>Aniculus</em>, and <em>Calcinus</em>) (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>c) Species that remove tissues but leave the skeleton intact: gastropods (<em>Jenneria pustulata</em> and <em>Quoyula</em> sp. (Glynn 2002)), buterflyfishes, angelfishes, damselfish (<em>Stegastes acapulcoensis</em>), and <em>Acanthaster planci</em> (Glynn 2002).<br/><br/>d) Species that abrade tissues and skeleton: <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/><em>Jenneria</em> and <em>Acanthaster can kill whole, relatively large (approx. 30 cm in diameter) colonies of <em>Pocillopora</em> (Glynn 2002). Pocilloporid species can have crab (<em>Trapezia</em> sp.) and alpheid shrimp as mutualistic symbionts that protect the coral from the attack of the crown-of-thorns sea star <em>A. planci</em> (Glynn 2001).","This species exhibited high bleaching and mortality in the 1998 bleaching event in Palau (Brunno <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Pocilloporid species as well as other major reef building corals within the Eastern Tropical Pacific region (<em>Porites</em>, <em>Pavona</em>, <em>Gardinoseris</em>) catastrophically declined in the Galápagos Archipelago and Cocos Island after 1983. Recovery observed since that time was in large part nullified by the 1997-98 ENSO event (Glynn 2000). According to Glynn <em>et al</em>.(1988), pocilloporid coral mortality in the eastern Pacific was high, ranging from 51% at Caño Island to 76-85% in Panama and 97-100% in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn <em>et al</em>. 1988). <br/><br/>Glynn (1994) suggests that the sea urchin <em>Eucidaris galapagensis</em> (syn. <em>E. thouarsii</em>) provides important biotic control of pocilloporid reef development. This urchin is the most persistent corallivore in the Galapagos Islands, where it is often observed grazing on pocilloporid corals (Glynn 2001). <br/><br/>Overfishing is probably responsible for some ecological imbalance on coral reefs that could prolong recovery from other disturbances (Glynn 2001). Moreover, Edgar <em>et al</em>.(unpublished manuscript) reported that over-exploitation of sea urchin predators (lobsters and fishes), along with ENSO, has a major effect in the condition and distribution of corals in the Galapagos Islands, by increasing the grazer and bioerosion pressure on corals. <br/><br/>Coral mortality associated with phytoplankton blooms has been reported from Caño Island, Costa Rica, and Uva Island, Panama, in 1985; where mortality of pocilloporid species (especially <em>P. capitata</em> and <em>P. elegans</em>) was in the order of 100% and 13% respectively at 3 m depth (Guzmán <em>et al</em>. 1990).<br/><br/>According to Glynn (2001), pocilloporid coral harvesting is an important threat in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region, specially along the continental coast. This activity has virtually eliminated pocilloporid corals from Acapulco (Mexico), Bahia Culebra (Costa Rica), Taboga Island (Panama), and parts of the coast of Ecuador (Glynn 2001). Nevertheless, this activity is now largely excluded from Costa Rica and Panama (Guzmán pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The total number of corals (live and raw) exported for this species in 2005 was 1,498.<br/><br/>Bryant <em>et al</em>. (1998), based on four anthropogenic factors (coastal development; overexploitation and destructive fishing practice; inland pollution and erosion, and marine pollution), estimated a high threat to coral reefs along the coasts of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. High levels of siltation caused by accelerated coastal erosion have degraded coral reefs in Costa Rica, Colombia and Ecuador (Glynn 2001)<br/><br/>Other threats include: a) predation principally by <em>Acanthaster</em> and <em>Jenneria</em> (Glynn 2002, 1994, 2000), and b) harvesting for the curio trade, an activity that has virtually eliminated pocilloporid corals from Acapulco (Mexico), Bahia Culebra (Costa Rica), Taboga Island (Panama), and parts of the coast of Ecuador (Glynn 2001).<br/><br/>In general, the major threat to corals is global climate change, in particular, temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide and a major cause of reef deterioration (Weil <em>et al</em>. 2006). The numbers of diseases and coral species affected, as well as the distribution of diseases have all increased dramatically within the last decade (Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Green and Bruckner 2000, Sutherland <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weil 2004). Coral disease epizootics have resulted in significant losses of coral cover and were implicated in the dramatic decline of acroporids in the Florida Keys (Aronson and Precht 2001, Porter <em>et al</em>. 2001, Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Indo-Pacific, disease is also on the rise with disease outbreaks recently reported from the Great Barrier Reef (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2004), Marshall Islands (Jacobson 2006) and the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Aeby 2006). Increased coral disease levels on the GBR were correlated with increased ocean temperatures (Willis <em>et al</em>. 2007) supporting the prediction that disease levels will be increasing with higher sea surface temperatures. Escalating anthropogenic stressors combined with the threats associated with global climate change of increases in coral disease, frequency and duration of coral bleaching and ocean acidification place coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific at high risk of collapse.<br/><br/>Localized threats to corals include fisheries, human development (industry, settlement, tourism, and transportation), changes in native species dynamics (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), invasive species (competitors, predators, pathogens and parasites), dynamite fishing, chemical fishing, pollution from agriculture and industry, domestic pollution, sedimentation, and human recreation and tourism activities. <br/><br/>The severity of these combined threats to the global population of each individual species is not known.","All corals are listed on CITES Appendix II. Parts of the species’ range fall within Marine Protected Areas.<br/><br/>Recommended measures for conserving this species include research in taxonomy, population, abundance and trends, ecology and habitat status, threats and resilience to threats, restoration action; identification, establishment and management of new protected areas; expansion of protected areas; recovery management; and disease, pathogen and parasite management. Artificial propagation and techniques such as cryo-preservation of gametes may become important for conserving coral biodiversity.<br/><br/>Having timely access to national-level trade data for CITES analysis reports would be valuable for monitoring trends this species. The species is targeted by collectors for the aquarium trade and fisheries management is required for the species, e.g., MPAs, quotas, size limits, etc. Consideration of the suitability of species for aquaria should also be included as part of fisheries management, and population surveys should be carried out to monitor the effects of harvesting. Recommended conservation measures include population surveys to monitor the effects of collecting for the aquarium trade, especially in Indonesia.",NA
133691,133691,NA,"This species is recently described. Therefore there is very little information available on its distribution, abundance, habitat preferences, and susceptibility to threats. This species is listed as Data Deficient. However, this species could fall into a threatened category if more information was known. Research on these aspects of this species’ ecology is recommended. This assessment should be re-evaluated in 10 years to include addition information and to determine the effects of continued or increased threats from climate change and ocean acidification.","This species occurs in the far eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>Records in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region: <strong>Mexico</strong>: Caleta de Chon, Manzanillo, Playa Coral and Morros del Potosi at Guerrero, and at La Tijera, Montosa and Mazunte in Oaxaca (Reyes-Bonilla 2003, Reyes-Bonilla <em>et al</em>. 2005); Clipperton Atoll (Glynn and Ault 2000); <strong>Ecuador</strong>: Galapagos Archipelago (Hickman 2005); potentially in Panama (Guzmán pers. comm.).","This species is common at Clipperton Atoll and rocky foreshores of western Mexico.  <br/><br/><em>Pocillopora</em> is common on most reefs, especially along the reef front, where it may occur in dense banks (Wood 1983). The genus <em>Pocillopora</em> is very common and very conspicuous.<br/><br/>According to Veron (2000), in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region the relative abundance of <em>Pocillopora effusus</em> is common at Clipperton Atoll, and on the rocky foreshore of western Mexico. Nevertheless, Reyes-Bonilla (2003) classified this specie as rare in mainland Mexico (Guerrero and Oaxaca). According to CONABIO (2006), in Mexico populations trends of this coral are presumed to be stable.<br/><br/>In the Galápagos Islands, the relative abundance of <em>P. effusus</em> varies between uncommon at the northern Islands of Darwin and Wolf to rare in the rest of the Archipelago (Hickman 2005).<br/><br/>In the event that the presence of <em>P. effusus</em> is confirmed in Panama, its populations should be regarded as uncommon or rare (Guzmán pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There is evidence that overall coral reef habitat has declined, and this is used as a proxy for population decline for this species. This species is particularly susceptible to bleaching, disease, and other threats and therefore population decline is based on both the percentage of destroyed reefs and critical reefs that are likely to be destroyed within 20 years (Wilkinson 2004). We assume that most, if not all, mature individuals will be removed from a destroyed reef and that on average, the number of individuals on reefs are equal across its range and proportional to the percentage destroyed reefs. Reef losses throughout the species' range have been estimated over three generations, two in the past and one projected into the future.<br/><br/>The age of first maturity of most reef building corals is typically three to eight years (Wallace 1999) and therefore we assume that average age of mature individuals is greater than eight years. Furthermore, based on average sizes and growth rates, we assume that average generation length is 10 years, unless otherwise stated. Total longevity is not known, but likely to be more than ten years. Therefore any population decline rates for the Red List assessment are measured over at least 30 years.&#160;<strong>See the Supplementary Material&#160;for further details on population decline and generation length estimates</strong>.",unknown,"Pocillopora is common on most reefs, especially along the reef front, where it may occur in dense banks (Wood 1983).<br/>Shallow reef environments and rocky foreshore that are exposed to strong wave action.<br/><br/>Pocilloporid corals, presumably including <em>P. effusus</em>, are generally amongst the strongest coral competitors with relatively high rates of calcification (Glynn 2001). However, coral species exhibiting high rates of calcification usually have relatively high mortality rates (Glynn 2000). Pocilloporid corals also usually predominate at shallow depths (1-15 m).
