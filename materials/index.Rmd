# Managing Ecological Data for Effective Use and Re-Use {-}

The research landscape is changing. Researchers are increasingly engaging in collaboration across networks; open science includes not just open publication but also open data, software, and workflows; and technology is evolving in support of this new paradigm. This workshop is designed to help researchers stay abreast of current best practices and initiatives and get an introduction to data management skills to maximize their productivity, share their data with the scientific community effectively and efficiently, and benefit from the re-use of their data by others.

### Code of Conduct

Please note that by participating in an NCEAS activity you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://live-ncea-ucsb-edu-v01.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/2020-02/NCEAS_Code-of-Conduct_2019.pdf)

```

#### The Power of Open

To facilitate a lively and interactive learning environment, we'll be calling on folks to share their code and to answer various questions posed by the instructor. It's completely okay to say "Pass" or "I Don't Know" - this is a supportive learning environment and we will all learn from each other. The instructors will be able to see your code as you go to help you if you get stuck, and the lead instructor may share participants' code to show a successful example or illustrate a teaching moment.

### Acknowledgements

Additional support was provided for working group collaboration by the Long Term Ecological Research Communications Office at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, a Center funded by the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the State of California.
