# Open Science Synthesis for the Delta Science Program: Week 3 {-#reproducible-research-techniques-for-synthesis}

![](images/DSP_Logo_Horizontal.jpg)

This book is for week 3 of 3, one-week facilitated synthesis and training events for Delta researchers that will revolve around scientific computing and scientific software for reproducible science.

Week 3 will focus on publishing data, data visualization and results communication, and will revisit reproducible workflows.

#### The Power of Open

To facilitate a lively and interactive learning environment, we'll be calling on folks to share their code and to answer various questions posed by the instructor. It's completely okay to say "Pass" or "I Don't Know" - this is a supportive learning environment and we will all learn from each other. The instructors will be able to see your code as you go to help you if you get stuck, and the lead instructor may share participants' code to show a successful example or illustrate a teaching moment.
