# Data Science Training for the Arctic Data Center {-#data-science-training-for-the-arctic-data-center}

[![arctic_data_logo](images/arctic-data-center.png)](https://arcticdata.io)

The [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io) conducts training in data science and management,
both of which are critical skills for stewardship of data, software, and other
products of research that are preserved at the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io).

### Code of Conduct

### Logistics

Pre-Covid, we ran this course as a 5-day, 8:00 am - 5:00 pm, intensive course in data science and data management. We asked that participants were as engaged as possible, clearing their schedules so that they could be fully engaged with us in person in Santa Barbara. We are asking for the **same level of commitment** in this remote setting, while understanding that some conflicts are unavoidable. 

We will be using the following tools to facilitate this training:

- Zoom
- Slack
- Mentimeter

When we're in session, please turn your camera on, and mute your microphone unless you would like to ask a question or contribute to a discussion. 

We recognize that working from home during the pandemic comes with challenges. The appearance or sound of other adults, children, or pets in remote meetings such as this is completely normal and understandable. Enabling the instructors and your fellow participants to see you brings some humanity to this physically distant workshop, and we believe that this is a crucial part to its success. If you would like to use the Zoom virtual background feature, you are welcome to, as long as your background of choice fits within the code of conduct (and [here](https://www.arcus.org/resources/virtual-backgrounds) are some Arctic backgrounds if you need inspiration).

When you need to ask a question, please do so in one of the following ways:

- Turn your mic on and ask, while being respectful of the instructor
- Ask your question in the slack channel 

If you have an issue/error and get stuck, you can ask for help in the following ways:

- Turn your mic on and ask for help, while being respectful of the instructor
- Let one of the instructors know in the slack channel
- If prompted to do so, put a red X next to your name as your status in the participant window
