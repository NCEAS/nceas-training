# Toolik Workshop: Intro to Data Publishing and Data Portals {-#open-science}

## About {-}

This half-day in-person workshop will provide researchers with an overview of reproducible and ethical research practices, steps and methods for more easily documenting and preserving their data at the Arctic Data Center, and an introduction to data portals. Responsible and reproducible data management practices will be discussed as they apply to all aspects of the data life cycle. This includes ethical data collection and data sharing, data sovereignty, and the [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) principles. The CARE principles are guidelines that help ensure open data practices (like the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles) appropriately engage with Indigenous Peoplesâ€™ rights and interests.
