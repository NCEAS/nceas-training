# Reproducible Practices for Arctic Research Using R {-#reproducible-research-techniques-for-synthesis}

![](images/arctic-data-center.png)

The [Arctic Data Center](http://arcticdata.io) conducts training in data science and management, both of which are critical skills for stewardship of data, software, and other products of research that are preserved at the Arctic Data Center.

## Schedule

Coming soon.

### Code of Conduct

Please note that by participating in an NCEAS activity you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://live-ncea-ucsb-edu-v01.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/2020-02/NCEAS_Code-of-Conduct_2019.pdf)



```{r footer_logo, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align = 'center'}

```

#### The Power of Open

To facilitate a lively and interactive learning environment, we'll be calling on folks to share their code and to answer various questions posed by the instructor. It's completely okay to say "Pass" or "I Don't Know" - this is a supportive learning environment and we will all learn from each other. The instructors will be able to see your code as you go to help you if you get stuck, and the lead instructor may share participants' code to show a successful example or illustrate a teaching moment.
