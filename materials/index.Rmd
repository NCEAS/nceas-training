# Creating Data Portals Workshop {-#open-science}

## About {-}

During these hands-on 60-minute workshops, participants will create a data portal on their own laptop, based on specified search criteria of their choosing. 

As the primary repository for the National Science Foundation’s Arctic Research Program, the Arctic Data Center accepts data from a wide variety of disciplines. The Arctic Data Center hosts user-designed data portals that are collections of data packages presented on their own page with a unique web address. Data portals provide researchers with a means to preserve information regarding a projects’ objectives, scopes, and organization of related datasets so it’s clear how to use and interpret collections of data for years to come. Portals also leverage Arctic Data Center’s metrics, which describe the project’s data packages. Information such as the total number of data packages within the portal, total volume of data, data citations, and data downloads are available from the portal webpage. Researchers can create portals to collate data according to data attributes and semantic annotations, disciplines, other themes, projects, or across projects (i.e., convergence projects).
