# Publishing Analyses to the Web

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:

- How to use git, GitHub (+Pages), and (R)Markdown to publish an analysis to the web

## Introduction

Sharing your work with others in engaging ways is an important part of the scientific process.
So far in this course, we've introduced a small set of powerful tools for doing open science:

- R and its many packages
- RStudio
- git
- GiHub
- RMarkdown

RMarkdown, in particular, is amazingly powerful for creating scientific reports but, so far, we haven't tapped its full potential for sharing our work with others.

In this lesson, we're going to take an existing GitHub repository and turn it into a beautiful and easy to read web page using the tools listed above.

## A Minimal Example

- Create a new repository on GitHub
- Initialize the repository on GitHub without any files in it
- In RStudio,
    - Create a new Project
    - When creating, select the option to create from Version Control -> Git
    - Enter your repository's clone URL in the Repository URL field and fill in the rest of the details
- Add a new file at the top level called `index.Rmd`. The easiest way to do this is through the RStudio menu. Choose File -> New File -> RMarkdown...  This will bring up a dialog box. You should create a "Document" in "HTML" format. These are the default options.
- Open `index.Rmd` (if it isn't already open)
- Press Knit

    Observe the rendered output
    Notice the new file in the same directory `index.html`.
    This is our RMarkdown file rendered as HTML (a web page)
- Commit your changes (to both index.Rmd and index.html)
- Open your web browser to the GitHub.com page for your repository
- Go to Settings > GitHub Pages and turn on GitHub Pages for the `master` branch

    Now, the rendered website version of your repo will show up at a special URL.
    
    GitHub Pages follows a convention like this:
    
     ![github pages url pattern](images/github_pages.png)
     
    Note that it will no longer be at github.com but github.io
     
- Go to https://{username}.github.io/{repo_name}/ (Note the trailing `/`)
    Observe the awesome rendered output
    
Now that we've successfully published a web page from an RMarkdown document, let's make a change to our RMarkdown document and follow the steps to actually publish the change on the web:

- Go back to our `index.Rmd`
- Delete all the content, except the YAML frontmatter
- Type "Hello world"
- Commit, push
- Go back to https://{username}.github.io/{repo_name}/
