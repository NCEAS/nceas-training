## About the course {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the Reproducible Practices for Arctic Research Using R course. In recent years we have adapted this course to be able to offer a fully remote opportunity. This has allowed us to expand our pool of participants taking our courses. Although we have had to switch to a remote training model, we ask participants to be as engaged during the instructional period while understanding conflicts are unavoidable. Your engagement and participation are crucial to make the best of this learning experience.

We will be using the following tools to facilitate this training:

-   Zoom
-   Slack (desktop app preferred)
-   RStudio, accessed through a server on an up-to-date
-   Web browser:
    -   Firefox (version 80+)
    -   Chrome (version 80+)
    -   Safari (version 13+)
    -   Edge (version 81+)
