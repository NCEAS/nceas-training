## About the course {.unnumbered}

This 5-day in-person workshop will provide researchers with an overview of reproducible and ethical research practices, steps and methods for more easily documenting and preserving their data at the Arctic Data Center, and an introduction to programming in R. Special attention will be paid to qualitative data management, including practices working with sensitive data. Example datasets will draw from natural and social sciences, and methods for conducting reproducible research will be discussed in the context of both qualitative and quantitative data. Responsible and reproducible data management practices will be discussed as they apply to all aspects of the data life cycle. This includes ethical data collection and data sharing, data sovereignty, and the [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) principles. The CARE principles are guidelines that help ensure open data practices (like the FAIR principles) appropriately engage with Indigenous Peoplesâ€™ rights and interests.
