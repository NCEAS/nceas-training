## Welcome! {.unnumbered}
coreR is a five-day immersion in R programming for environmental data science. Researchers will gain experience with essential data science tools and best practices to increase their capacity as collaborators, reproducible coders, and open scientists.

### Course Learning Objectives
-   Increase your familiarity and confidence with data science tools
-   Overview of tools you can use within the R programming language and RStudio interface
-   Effectively manage data using `tidy` data practices and understanding the importance of quality metadata
-   Establish best practices and utilize tools like Git & GitHub to optimize collaboration
-   Better communicate scientific analyses and results using Markdown, GitHub webpages, and R packages like `ggplot` and `leaflet`

## NCEAS Expertise

The [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), a research affiliate of UCSB, is a leading expert on interdisciplinary data science and works collaboratively to answer the world's largest and most complex questions. The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called [synthesis science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach).

NCEAS has over 25 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals. Together with the Delta Science Program and the Delta Stewardship Council we are excited to pass along skills, workflows, mindsets learn throughout the years.
