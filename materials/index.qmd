## About the Series {.unnumbered}

We are excited to announce a new NCEAS Training Series specifically designed to help Working Groups collaborate effectively. For new working groups we highly encourage participation in the first three *“Working Group Essentials”* trainings. These are designed to prepare working groups during the early stages of the collaboration process with tips on facilitation, data management and communications. We also have a series of *“Extended Learning”* trainings that are open to all working groups and focus on specific skills around data management and communications.

We encourage you to review the list of trainings and the attached information sheet and discuss with your team which trainings you are personally interested in as well as which ones you might find beneficial as a group. Space is limited, please register by following the links for each training below. We will also send monthly reminders with information about each training and a registration reminder. All trainings will be held on Zoom, please check out more detailed information about each training here.

All training materials will be available in this book after each training.

<!-- ### Learning Objectives -->

<!-- MAYBE ADD OVER ALL LEARNING OBJECTIVES? -->

## NCEAS Expertise

The [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), a research affiliate of UCSB, is a leading expert on interdisciplinary data science and works collaboratively to answer the world's largest and most complex questions. The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called [synthesis science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach).

NCEAS has over 25 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals. Together with the Delta Science Program and the Delta Stewardship Council we are excited to pass along skills, workflows, mindsets learn throughout the years.
