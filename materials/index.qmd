Hosted by the [National Center for Ecological Anlysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) and in partnership with [UCSB's Office of Research](https://www.research.ucsb.edu/), this seminar series is a training program where participants engage in synthesis research in a small cohort. It will equip participants with data science and team science tools, and provide them with a platform to conduct collaborative synthesis research. The overall aim is to grow cross-departmental relationships and interdisciplinary research outputs.
