NCEAS Open Science Synthesis training is a three 1-week long workshops, geared towards early career researchers. Participants engage in a mix of lectures, exercises, and synthesis research groups to do synthesis  while learning and implementing best practices for open science.


<!-- CoreR A five-day immersion in R programming for environmental data science. Researchers will gain experience with essential data science tools and best practices to increase their capacity as collaborators, reproducible coders, and open scientists.-->

### Learning Objectives:


-   Effectively manage data using `tidy` data practices and developing quality metadata
-   Implement reproducible scientific workflows throughout all aspects of a project
-   Build data visualizations and reusable reports using `ggplot`, `markdown`, and GitHub
- Increase your familiarity and confidence with data science tools
