## About this training

The **NCEAS openS Program** consists of three 1-week long workshops, geared towards early career researchers. Participants engage in a mix of lectures, exercises, and synthesis research activities to conduct synthesis science and implement best practices in open data science.

openS has been adapted to coincide with each USGS CAP training, for a total of four training sessions across 2 years.

## Why NCEAS

The [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), a research affiliate of UCSB, is a leading expert on interdisciplinary data science and works collaboratively to answer the world's largest and most complex questions. The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called [synthesis science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach).

NCEAS has over 25 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals. Together with the Delta Science Program and the Delta Stewardship Council we are excited to pass along skills, workflows, mindsets learn throughout the years.

### Week 3: Scaling up and presenting synthesis

*October 23 â€“ 27, 2023*


- Big data workflows and parallel computing
- Presenting results using Shiny or flexdashboards
- Revisit reproducible and git workflows
- Synthesis presentations and next steps
