:::

Hosted by the [National Center for Ecological Anlysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) and in partnership with [UCSB's Office of Research](https://www.research.ucsb.edu/), this seminar series is a training program where participants engage in synthesis research in a small cohort. It will equip participants with data science and team science tools, and provide them with a platform to conduct collaborative synthesis research. The overall aim is to grow cross-departmental relationships and interdisciplinary research outputs.


## NCEAS Expertise

NCEAS, a research affiliate of UCSB, is a leading expert on interdisciplinary data science and works collaboratively to answer the world's largest and most complex questions. The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called [synthesis science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach). NCEAS has over 25 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals.


## Week One: Crafting Your Synthesis Research Question

*September 11 - 15, 2023*

### Learning Objectives

-   Participants will develop research ideas and utilize environmental data science (EDS) skills to test the feasibility of the project and assess the quality of data associated with it
-   Participants will create a Data Management Plan as a tool for adaptive research, and apply new EDS skills and tools to progress research and synthesis research products
