## About this training

The **NCEAS openS Program** consists of three 1-week long workshops, geared towards early career researchers. Participants engage in a mix of lectures, exercises, and synthesis research activities to conduct synthesis science and implement best practices in open data science.

openS has been adapted to coincide with each USGS CAP training, for a total of four training sessions across 2 years.

## Why NCEAS

The [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), a research affiliate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, is a leading expert on interdisciplinary data science and works collaboratively to answer the world's largest and most complex questions. The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called [synthesis science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach).

NCEAS has over 25 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals, and we are excited to pass on this cumulative expertise to you.


## Week One: Successful Synthesis and Data Management Best Practices

### Learning Objectives:

-   Implement reproducible scientific workflows throughout all aspects of a project
-   Increase your familiarity and confidence with data science tools
-   Effectively manage and wrangle data using `tidy` data practices
-   Accessing, interpreting and developing metadata for synthesis research
-   Organize and initiate synthesis projects
