## About this training

NCEAS Open Science Synthesis training is a three 1-week long workshops, geared towards early career researchers. Participants engage in a mix of lectures, exercises, and synthesis research groups to do synthesis  while learning and implementing best practices for open science.


<!-- CoreR A five-day immersion in R programming for environmental data science. Researchers will gain experience with essential data science tools and best practices to increase their capacity as collaborators, reproducible coders, and open scientists.-->

## Why NCEAS
The [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), a research affiliate of UCSB, is a leading expert on interdisciplinary data science and works collaboratively to answer the world's largest and most complex questions. The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called [synthesis science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach).

NCEAS has over 25 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals. Together with the Delta Science Program and the Delta Stewardship Council we are excited to pass along skills, workflows, mindsets learn throughout the years.
