# Linux and the Command Line


## Introduction to UNIX and its siblings

UNIX
 :  Originally developed at AT&T Bell Labs circa 1970. Has
     experienced a [long, multi-branched
     evolutionary path](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg)

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)
 :  a set of specifications of what an OS needs to qualify as "a Unix", to enhance interoperability among all the "Unix" variants


### Various Unices

![The unix family tree](images/unix-history-simple.png)

* OS X
 :  [is a Unix](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1489/is-mac-os-x-unix)!
* Linux
 :  is _not_ fully POSIX-compliant, but certainly can be
      regarded as [functionally Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like)
      

### Some Unix hallmarks

* Supports multi-users, multi-processes
* Highly modular: many small tools that do one thing well, and can be combined
* Culture of text files and streams
* Primary OS on HPC (**High Performance Computing** Systems)
* Main OS on which Internet was built

    
## The Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI provides a direct way to interact with the Operating System, by typing in commands. 

### Why the CLI is worth learning

* Typically much more extensive access to features, commands, options
* Command statements can be written down, saved (scripts!)
* Easier automation
* Much "cheaper" to do work on a remote system (no need to
      transmit all the graphical stuff over the network)
      
### Connecting to a remote server via `ssh`

From the gitbash (MS Windows) or the terminal (Mac) type:

```bash
ssh aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu
```
You will be prompted for your username and password.

![aurora_ssh](images/aurora-ssh.png)

You can also directly add your username:

```bash
ssh brun@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu
```

In this case, you will be only asked for your password as you already specified which user you want to connect with.


** You can also use the terminal from RStudio!!**

## Navigating and managing files/directories in *NIX

* `pwd`: Know where you are
* `ls`: List the content of the directory
* `cd`: Go inside a directory
* `~` : Home directory
* `.` : Here (current directory)
* `..`: Up one level (upper directory)


* go to my "Home" directory:  `cd ~`
* go up one directory level: `cd ..`
* list the content: `ls`
* list the content showing hidden files: `ls -a`  note that `-a` is referred as an option (modifies the command)
 
More files/directories manipulations:

* `mkdir`: Create a directory
* `cp`: Copy a file
* `mv`: Move a file
* `rm` /`rmdir`: Remove a file / directory  **use those carefully, there is no return / Trash!!**

### Permissions

![File permissions](images/UnixFileLongFormat.png)

### Exercise

Navigate to the repo we created and inspect its content using the CLI

**Note: typing is not your thing? the `<tab>` key is your friend!** One hit it will auto-complete the file/directory/path name for you. If there are many options, hit it twice to see the options.

## General command syntax

* `$ command [options] [arguments]`

where `command` must be an _executable_ file on your `PATH`
* `echo $PATH`

and `options` can usually take two forms
* short form: `-a`
* long form: `--all`

You can combine the options:

```bash
ls -ltrh
```

What do these options do?

```bash
man ls
```

### find

Show me my Rmarkdown files!

```bash
find . -iname '*.Rmd'
```

Which files are larger than 1GB?

```bash
find . -size +1G
```
With more details about the files:

```bash
find . -size +1G -ls
```

## Getting things done

### Some useful, special commands using the Control key

* Cancel (abort) a command: `Ctrl-c`
* Stop (suspend) a command: `Ctrl-z`
* `Ctrl-z` can be used to suspend, then background a process


### Process management

* Like Windows Task Manager, OSX Activity Monitor
* **`top`**, `ps`, `jobs` (hit `q` to get out!)
* `kill` to delete an unwanted job or process
* Foreground and background: `&`


### What about "space"

* How much storage is available on this system?  `df -h`
* How much storage am "I" using overall?  `du -hs <folder>`
* How much storage am "I" using, by subdirectory?  `du -h <folder>`


## Uploading Files

You have several options to upload files to the server. Some are more convenient if you have few files, like RStudio interface, some are more built for uploading a lot of files at one, like specific software... and you guessed it the CLI :)

### RStudio

You can only upload one file at the time (you can zip a folder to trick it):

![](images/rstudio-upload.png)

### sFTP Software

An efficient protocol to upload files is FTP (File Transfer Protocol). The `s` stands for secured. Any software supporting those protocols will work to transfer files. 

We recommend the following free software:

- Mac users: [cyberduck]( https://cyberduck.io)
- Windows: [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)

![](images/server-cyberduck.png)

### `scp`

The `scp` command is another convenient way to transfer a single file or directory using the CLI. You can run it from Aurora or from your local computer. Here is the basic syntax:

```
scp </source/path> <hostname:/path/to/destination/>
```

Here is an example of my uploading the file `10min-loop.R` to Aurora from my laptop. The destination directory on Aurora is `/home/brun/github_com/NCEAS/nceas-training/materials/files`:

```bash
scp 10min-loop.R brun@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu:/home/brun/github_com/NCEAS/nceas-training/materials/files
```


![](images/server-scp.png)

If you want to upload an entire folder, you can add the `-r` option to the command. The general syntax is:

```bash
scp -r /path/to/source-folder user@server:/path/to/destination-folder/
```


Here is an example uploading all the images in the `myplot` folder 

```bash
scp -r myplots brun@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu:/home/brun/github_com/NCEAS/nceas-training/materials/images
```



## Advanced Topics:

### Unix systems are multi-user
* Who else is logged into this machine?  `who`
* Who is logged into "this shell"?  `whoami`

### A sampling of simple commands for dealing with files

* `wc` count lines, words, and/or characters
* `diff` compare two files for differences
* `sort` sort lines in a file
* `uniq` report or filter out repeated lines in a file


### All files have permissions and ownership

* Change permissions: `chmod`
* Change ownership: `chown`
* List files showing ownership and permissions: `ls -l`

			schild@aurora:~/postdoc-training/data$ ls -l
			total 1136
			-rw----r-- 1 schild scientist 1062050 May 29  2007 AT_85_to_89.csv
			-rwxrwxr-x 1 schild scientist   16200 Jun 26 11:20 env.csv
			-rwxr-xr-x 1 schild scientist   23358 Jun 26 11:20 locale.csv
			-rwxrwx--- 1 schild scientist    7543 Jun 26 11:20 refrens.csv
			-rwx------ 1 schild scientist   46653 Jun 26 11:20 sample.csv 		
* Clear contents in terminal window: `clear`


### Getting help

* `<command> -h`, `<command> --help`
* `man`, `info`, `apropos`, `whereis`
* Search the web!


### History

* See your command history:  `history`
* Re-run last command:  `!!`  (pronounced "bang-bang")
* Re-run 32th command: `!32`
* Re-run 5th from last command: `!-5`
* Re-run last command that started with 'c': `!c`


### Get into the flow, with pipes 

![`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`](images/pipe_split.png
    "http://www.ucblueash.edu/thomas/Intro_Unix_Text/Images/pipe_split.png")

```bash
$ ls *.png | wc -l
$ ls *.png | wc -l > pngcount.txt
$ diff <(sort file1.txt) <(sort file2.txt)
$ ls foo 2>/dev/null
```
* note use of `*` as character wildcard for zero or more matches (same in Mac and Windows); `%` is equivalent wildcard match in SQL queries
* `?` matches single character; `_` is SQL query equivalent


### Text editing

#### Some editors

* `vim`
* `emacs`
* `nano`

```
$ nano .bashrc
```

#### Let's look at our text file

* `cat` print file(s)
* `head` print first few lines of file(s)
* `tail` print last few lines of file(s)
* `less` "pager" -- view file interactively (type `q` to quit command)qqqbf
*   `od --t` "octal dump" -- to view file's underlying binary/octal/hexadecimal/ASCII format

 * `od` is especially useful in searching for **hidden characters** in your data
 * watch for **carriage return** `\r` and **new line** `\n\` 
 * `dos2unix` and `unix2dos` 



### Create custom commands with "alias"
alias lwc='ls *.jpg | wc -l'

You can create a number of custom aliases that are available whenever you login, by putting commands such as the above in your shell start-up file, e.g. `.bashrc`


### A sampling of more advanced utilities

* `grep` search files for text
* `sed` filter and transform text
* `find` advanced search for files/directories


#### grep

Show all lines containing "bug" in my R scripts

```bash
$ grep bug *.R
```

Now count the number of occurrences per file

```bash
$ grep -c bug *.R
```

Print the names of files that contain bug

```bash
$ grep -l bug *.R
```

Print the lines of files that __don't__ contain bug

```bash
$ grep -v bug *.R
```

Print "hidden" dot-files in current directory
```
$ ls -a | grep '^\.'   
```
#### sed

Remove all lines containing "bug"!

```bash
$ sed '/bug/d' myscript.R
```

Call them buglets, not bugs!

```bash
$ sed 's/bug/buglet/g' myscript.R
```

Actually, only do this on lines starting with #

```bash
$ sed '/#/ s/bug/buglet/g' myscript.R
```
   

## Online resources

Above are just a few of the most useful Linux & Unix commands based on our experience.  There are many more, and they comprise a ***rich*** set, that will serve you for years. They can be used in combination, and run from scripts.  They can empower you when using high-end analytical servers, or doing repetitive tasks!
