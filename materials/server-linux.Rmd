# All about the *NIX

UNIX
 :  Originally developed at AT&T Bell Labs circa 1970. Has
     experienced a [long, multi-branched
     evolutionary path](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Unix_history-simple.svg)

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)
 :  a set of specifications of what an OS needs to qualify as "a Unix", to enhance interoperability among all the "Unix" variants


## Various Unices

![The unix family tree](images/400px-Unix_history.svg.png
    "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Unix_history.svg/1000px-Unix_history.svg.png")

* OS X
 :  [is a Unix](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1489/is-mac-os-x-unix)!
* Linux
 :  is _not_ fully POSIX-compliant, but certainly can be
      regarded as [functionally Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like)
      

## Some Unix hallmarks

* Supports multi-users, multi-processes
* Highly modular: many small tools that do one thing well, and can be combined
* Culture of text files and streams
* Primary OS on HPC (**High Performance Computing** Systems)
* Main OS on which Internet was built

    
## The Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a direct way to interact with the Operating System, by typing in commands. 

![Command Line](images/aurora_schild.png)


## Why the CLI is worth learning

* Typically much more extensive access to features, commands, options
* Command statements can be written down, saved (scripts!)
* Easier automation
* Much "cheaper" to do work on a remote system (no need to
      transmit all the graphical stuff over the network)
      
## Connecting to a remote server via `ssh`

From the gitbash (MS Windows) or the terminal (Mac) type:

```bash
ssh aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu
```
You will be prompted for your username and password.

![aurora_ssh](images/aurora-ssh.png)

You can also directly add your username:

```bash
ssh brun@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu
```

In this case, you will be only asked for your password as you already specified which user you want to connect with.




## Navigating and managing files/directories in *NIX

* `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`
* `~`, `.`, `..`
* go to my "Home" directory:  `cd ~`
* go up one directory level: `cd ..`
* `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`
* `rm`, `rmdir`


## Permissions

![File permissions](images/UnixFileLongFormat.png)

### All files have permissions and ownership


* Change permissions: `chmod`
* Change ownership: `chown`
* List files showing ownership and permissions: `ls -l`

			schild@aurora:~/postdoc-training/data$ ls -l
			total 1136
			-rw----r-- 1 schild scientist 1062050 May 29  2007 AT_85_to_89.csv
			-rwxrwxr-x 1 schild scientist   16200 Jun 26 11:20 env.csv
			-rwxr-xr-x 1 schild scientist   23358 Jun 26 11:20 locale.csv
			-rwxrwx--- 1 schild scientist    7543 Jun 26 11:20 refrens.csv
			-rwx------ 1 schild scientist   46653 Jun 26 11:20 sample.csv 		
* Clear contents in terminal window: `clear`


## Getting help

![I will ask for help before my problems get out of control](images/asking-for-help.jpg
    "http://www.socialconfidencecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/asking-for-help.jpg")  

* `<command> -h`, `<command> --help`
* `man`, `info`, `apropos`, `whereis`
* Search the web!

## General command syntax

* `$ command [options] [arguments]`

### where `command` must be an _executable_ file on your `PATH`
* `echo $PATH`

### and `options` can usually take two forms
* short form: `-h`
* long form: `--help`

### some useful, special commands using the Control key
* Cancel (abort) a command: `Ctrl-c`
* Stop (suspend) a command: `Ctrl-z`
* `Ctrl-z` can be used to suspend, then background a process

### History
* See your command history:  `history`
* Re-run last command:  `!!`  (pronounced "bang-bang")
* Re-run 32th command: `!32`
* Re-run 5th from last command: `!-5`
* Re-run last command that started with 'c': `!c`


## Unix systems are multi-user
* Who else is logged into this machine?  `who`
* Who is logged into "this shell"?  `whoami`

## What about "space"
* How much storage is available on this system?  `df -h`
* How much storage am "I" using overall?  `du -hs`
* How much storage am "I" using, by subdirectory?  `du -h`

<!--
```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf
```
-->

## find

![Search for stuff](images/rover.gif
  "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jTQNmLGBIFU/RwZN0Kv3ZYI/AAAAAAAAAvI/ubSNKrTgpms/s400/rover.gif")

### Like Rover, the Windows search dog. But more useful.

## find

### Show me my pdfs!

```bash
$ find . -iname '*.pdf'
```

### Which files are larger than 10GB?

```bash
$ find . -size +10G -ls
```

## A sampling of simple commands for dealing with files

* `wc` count lines, words, and/or characters
* `diff` compare two files for differences
* `sort` sort lines in a file
* `uniq` report or filter out repeated lines in a file
 

## Get into the flow, with pipes 

![`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`](images/pipe_split.png
    "http://www.ucblueash.edu/thomas/Intro_Unix_Text/Images/pipe_split.png")

```bash
$ ls *.jpg | wc -l
$ ls *.jpg | wc -l > jpegcount.txt
$ diff <(sort file1.txt) <(sort file2.txt)
$ ls foo 2>/dev/null
```
* note use of `*` as character wildcard for zero or more matches (same in Mac and Windows); `%` is equivalent wildcard match in SQL queries
* `?` matches single character; `_` is SQL query equivalent

## Getting things done

* Process management
    * Like Windows Task Manager, OSX Activity Monitor
    * `top`, `ps`, `jobs`
    * `kill` to delete an unwanted job or process
* Foreground and background: `&`
* Stay persistent with `Byobu`: to keep your session live even if you disconnect, type this once logged in the server:  ```byobu-enable```


## Optional:

## Text editing

### (Text rules!)

### Some editors

* `vim`
* `emacs`
* `nano`

### `$ nano .bashrc`

## Let's look at our text file

* `cat` print file(s)
* `head` print first few lines of file(s)
* `tail` print last few lines of file(s)
* `less` "pager" -- view file interactively (type `q` to quit command)qqqbf
*   `od --t` "octal dump" -- to view file's underlying binary/octal/hexadecimal/ASCII format

```
   
 * `od` is especially useful in searching for **hidden characters** in your data
 * watch for **carriage return** `\r` and **new line** `\n\` 
 * `dos2unix` and `unix2dos` 



## Create custom commands with "alias"
alias lwc='ls *.jpg | wc -l'

You can create a number of custom aliases that are available whenever you login, by putting commands such as the above in your shell start-up file, e.g. `.bashrc`


## A sampling of more advanced utilities

* `grep` search files for text
* `sed` filter and transform text
* `find` advanced search for files/directories

## grep

![The file pattern searcher](images/needle_in_a_haystack-300x223.jpg
   "http://ubuntuservergui.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/needle_in_a_haystack-300x223.jpg")

## grep

### Show all lines containing "bug" in my R scripts

```bash
$ grep bug *.R
```

### Now count the number of occurrences per file

```bash
$ grep -c bug *.R
```

### Print the names of files that contain bug

```bash
$ grep -l bug *.R
```

### Print the lines of files that __don't__ contain bug

```bash
$ grep -v bug *.R
```

### Print "hidden" dot-files in current directory
```
$ ls -a | grep '^\.'   
```
## sed

![The high tech filter](images/chromeblack-faucet-filter.jpg
  "http://www.greenliness.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/c/h/chromeblack-faucet-filter.jpg")

## sed

### Remove all lines containing "bug"!

```bash
$ sed '/bug/d' myscript.R
```

### Call them buglets, not bugs!

```bash
$ sed 's/bug/buglet/g' myscript.R
```

### Actually, only do this on lines starting with #

```bash
$ sed '/#/ s/bug/buglet/g' myscript.R
```

## Above are just a few of the most useful Linux & Unix commands based on our experience.  
###There are many more, and they comprise a ***rich*** set, that will serve you for years. They can be used in combination, and run from scripts.  They can empower you when using high-end analytical servers, or doing repetitive tasks!
