This workshop is a shortened version of our week long course in reproducible research. The week long course expands on these ideas and teaches software tools such as:

* git/GitHub
* Rmarkdown
* wrangling data with the `tidyverse` in R
* data visualization in R
* writing functions and packages
* writing reproducible papers
