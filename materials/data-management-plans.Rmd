## When to plan: The Data Lifecycle

Shown below is one version of the D[ata Life Cycle](https://www.dataone.org/data-life-cycle) that was developed by DataONE. The data life cycle provides a high level overview of the stages involved in successful management and preservation of data for use and reuse. Multiple versions of a data life cycle exist with differences attributable to variation in practices across domains or communities. It is not neccesary for researchers to move through the data life cycle in a cylical fashion and some research activities might use only part of the life cycle. For instance, a project involving meta-analysis might focus on the Discover, Integrate, and Analyze steps, while a project focused on primary data collection and analysis might bypass the Discover and Integrate steps. However, 'Plan' is at the top of the data life cycle as it is advisable to initiate your data management planning at the beginning of your research process, before any data has been collected.
