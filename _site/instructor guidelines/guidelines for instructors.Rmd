###Guidelines to consider for curriculum development.
1. A single rmd per lesson.
2. Keep rmd in main dir of repo (for bookdown or rmarkdown knit to a wesite).
3. Use a folder with same name as rmd lesson to source supporting materials.
4. Keep all materials (when possible) within this ecosystem.
5. Even if your lesson is outside an rmd file, please prep an rmd.
6. Within each rmd, please include the following sections: introduction, learning outcomes, and summary. Then use added sections as needed depending on less.
