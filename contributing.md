- our team may request changes before we will approve the Pull Request, or we will make them for you
- once the code is reviewed, our team will merge in your changes and you're done!

## Materials Development Workflow

Changes to materials, including adding lessons or events, are managed through the git repository at https://github.com/NCEAS/nceas-training. The repository is organized into several branches, each corresponding to a specific training event. This allows for material to be selected, remixed, and adapted to fit the specific needs of each event.

**master**. The `master` branch represents the most recent version of materials used in any event. 

**YYYY-MM-org**. Event branches are named with the year and month in which the event takes place, and the organization or name of the event. For example, the October 2020 Arctic Data Center training event materials are located under 2020-10-arctic.

### Material Development Guidelines

Lesson content is stored in `materials/sections/`. Bookdown sections are generated in the top level of the `materials/` directory, which knit together the child RMarkdown section documents.

In expanding existing materials you are welcome to:

- add a new section as an Rmd to the `materials/sections` directory
- add or edit material to existing Rmd sections

In developing content for a new event you will likely need to:

- create top level Rmd files in `materials/` that select the sections you are teaching
- edit `materials/index.Rmd` to customize introductory material to your event
- edit `materials/_bookdown.yml` to include the chapters in `materials/` that you are teaching.


We ask that you not:

- delete content wholesale. Content that you are not teaching can remain in the repository without needing to be deleted. Instead, select content via your chapters in `materials/` and the content of `materials/_bookdown.yml`.
- commit very large data or presentation files.
