##Meta-analysis  

![](meta-analysis/meta.jpg)     

###Introduction
**Purpose:** To examine meta-analysis as a tool for scientific synthesis. This workshop will include a workflow from primary literature compilation to meta-analysis.

**Background:**
Meta-analysis is a powerful scientific synthesis tool.
The first step to be able to critically read and assess their relative merits because of their increasing frequency on most domains of evidence-based inquiry. 

**Explanation:**
No slide decks. Ideal to keep all materials within ecosystem. Use this single rmd as your mechanism to explain, show, lecture, or demo/use tutorial to explain concepts.

**Products for your open science portfolio:**  
1. A compiled dataset of primary data on a topic of interest.  
2. A GitHub repo.  
3. An rmd file with code and one data viz running a meta-analysis.  
4. A PRISMA report.  


###Learning outcomes
1. To be able to 
2. To examine
3. To appreciate
4. To explore

###Exercise: meta-analysis
A sample exercise or tutorial to complete.
Herein, we will use effect sizes already compliled from an existing published study.

```{r exercise, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#demo an effect size dataset in metafor
#then show workflow working from start: primary to derived data.
#then student exercise with goal of finding/scraping 5-10 studies, one effect size each for analysis.

```


###Exercise: PRISMA report

###Exercise: Data collection

###Summary


**Recommendation:** - even if your lesson is outside an rmd file, please prep one and include introduction, learning outcomes, and sumnmary and link to data repository or other tool you are showing.  This is a placeholder for the students for the lesson and a mechanism for documenting what we teach.
