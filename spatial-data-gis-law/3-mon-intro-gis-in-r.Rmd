## Work with vector data in R

<a href="https://earthdatascience.org/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-4/intro-vector-data-r/" target="_blank">Intro to vector data in R - Earth Data Science website</a>

![Point, line OR polygon features can be stored within a vector dataset ](https://earthdatascience.org/images/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-5/pnt_line_poly.png)

There are many ways to import and map vector data in R.

To read the data, you have several options

* `sp`: Import shapefiles and other data using `readOGR()` from the `sp` package
* `sp`: more recently the `sf` package has proved to be both faster and more efficient that `sp`
* if you have geojson data - there are several json packages that you can use - check out <a href="https://earthdatascience.org/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-10/co-water-data-spatial-r/">this tutorial on dealing with geojson imported from API's in R if you're interested in learning more</a>.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE)
```


```{r}
# unzip data
#library(utils) 
setwd("~/Documents/data/oss-institute")
#setwd("~/Documents/github/oss-lessons/spatial-data-gis-law")
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(ggplot2)
library(rgeos)
library(mapview)
library(broom) # if you plot with ggplot and need to turn sp data into dataframes
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

First, let's download some data from natural earth.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# download the data 
download.file("http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/physical/ne_10m_coastline.zip", 
              destfile = 'coastlines.zip')

# unzip the file
unzip(zipfile = "coastlines.zip", 
      exdir = 'ne-coastlines-10m')
```

Next, we can open the data using `readOGR` from the sp (spatial) package. 

```{r}
# load the data 
coastlines <- readOGR("ne-coastlines-10m/ne_10m_coastline.shp")

```

Are the data points, lines of polygons?  
CHALLENGE -- Looking at the data, what are the 2 possible vector data structures 
that this data could be stored in?

```{r}
# view spatial attributes
class(coastlines)
extent(coastlines)
crs(coastlines)
```

Super speedy quick plot with R baseplot ... or not. Be patient - this object has 
a lot of complex features

```{r}
plot(coastlines, 
     main = "Global Coastlines")
```


 
This particular layer is complex. There are many details in the boundaries as 
rendered that we may want if we zoom in but may not need to produce a global 
map. let's **Simplify** it. The `gSimplify` function is a part of the rgeos 
package. The simplify function removes vertices from complex lines. Remember that a line is composed of vertices. A circle is simply a line with lots of vertices - the more vertices it has, the more 'round' the line appears.  
![Simplify vertices](http://suite.opengeo.org/docs/latest/_images/simplify.png)

As you use this function keep in mind that you are modifying your data.
You probably don't want to do this if you are performing any sort of quantitative analysis
on the data but you definitely want to do this if you are creating online 
maps and other visual products from your data. 

The `gSimplify` function takes 3 arguments

1. the data that you want to simplify
2. tol - the **tol**erance value - a large number will remove more vertices, make the data small AND yield a "blockier" looking object. a SMALLER number will retain more vertices and maintain a smoother looking feature.  
  
```{r}
# simplify geometry
coastlines_simp <- gSimplify(coastlines, 
                            tol = 3, 
                            topologyPreserve = TRUE)
```


```{r}
plot(coastlines_simp,
     main = "map with boundaries simplified")
```

Notice that here the map plots faster, but now it looks blocky.
We may have simplified TOO MUCH. let's 
reduce the `tol =` argument value to .1. 

```{r}
# simplify with a lower tolerance value (keeping more detail)
coastlines_sim2 <- gSimplify(coastlines, 
                             tol = .1, 
                             topologyPreserve = TRUE)
plot(coastlines_sim2, 
     main = "Map of coastlines - simplified geometry\n tol=.1")
```

That's better. We now have enough detail for plotting purposes but have increased
speed dramatically. These types of steps become important when creating online interactive
maps to optimize speed. 

IMPORTANT: when you modify the geometry you are also modifying the data 
- in this case any calculated perimeter or area values using these 
data will be compromised.

## ggplot example 

Less speedy plot with ggplot -- but it looks so nice! 
NOTE: ggplot throws an error if you don't include the `data = `
argument for some reason on your geom_ element. Be sure to always
expliceltly include this.

```{r }

# turn the data into a spatial data frame 
coastlines_sim2_df <- SpatialLinesDataFrame(coastlines_sim2,
                                            coastlines@data) 
#tidy(coastlines_sim2_df)

# plot the data 
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = coastlines_sim2_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  labs(title = "Global Coastlines - using ggplot")

```

`coord_fixed()` is your best friend -- it will make the map x and y 
Also notice i'm using labs to add a title and x and y axis labels. Cool stuff. 
  
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = coastlines_sim2_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed() + 
  labs(title = "My awesome ggplot map of coastlines",
       subtitle = "my awesome subtitle",
       x = "", y = "") # cause we don't need x and y labels do we?
```

## Interactive maps with leaflet 

Make it interactive using mapview. Mapview is just a wrapper for 
leaflet. ![Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) is a powerful javascript based tool that can be used to 
create interactive maps - like google maps. The `mapview` library 
in `R` is a wrapper around leaflet that allows you to quickly create 
interactive maps.

**COOL TIP 1:** note that when you knit to html your interactive map will 
be embedded in your html file! This means you can send your friends
(or yourself! :) ) and interactive map! 
**COOL TIP 2:** you can also publish your interactive map to rpubs! 
Bryce will talk more about this later today.

```{r, leaflet-map}
# create leaflet 
mapview(coastlines_sim2)
```

## Vector data with SF

This is all great but -- a bit slow. Sf will be the wave of the future. 
It's much faster than sp however isn't fully supported across all tools and projects
just yet... it will be! Below is just a quick example of how it works. We won't use
it for today's lesson...

```{r}
library(sf)
# import the data - sf is much faster
coastlines_sf <- st_read("ne-coastlines-10m/ne_10m_coastline.shp")
# plotting is still a bit slow
plot(coastlines_sf[2])

```

`SF` will have full ggplot support in the future but for now, you can 
only get to it by installing ggplot from the github dev branch.
For this reason we won't use sf in this workshop but know that it will be more popular
in the upcoming years.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# this only works if you install ggplot from github

#devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
#library(ggplot2)
# the dev version is not currently installing properly
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=coastlines_sf, aes(fill = featurecla))  
```


### Plot two layers on top of each other 

Next, let's import another data layer and plot it on top of our coastlines.

```{r}
us_states <- readOGR("us-boundaries/us_bound_pop.shp")
us_states
```

Use add = TRUE to plot us_states on top of 

```{r}
plot(coastlines_sim2, 
     main = "Coastlines with the NE state boundaries")
plot(us_states, 
     add = TRUE,
     col = "purple")
```

CHALLENGE - 
Next, create a map with the following layers

1. coastlines_sim2
1. us_states
1. study-area/study-area-merc.shp

Note that you will need to first import the study area layer and then
add it to your map. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
# import gulf study area
gulf_study_area <- readOGR("study-area/study-area-merc.shp")
plot(gulf_study_area,
     main = "map of the gulf study area")

```

We've plotted each of them previously so we know the data are OK.
How does it go?

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(coastlines_sim2, 
     main = "Coastlines with the NE state boundaries")
plot(us_states, 
     add = TRUE,
     col = "purple")
plot(gulf_study_area, 
     add = TRUE,
     col = "red")
```

### Dealing with coordinate reference systems

Our data are in different coordinate reference systems. To account 
for that, we need reproject one layer to be the same as the other.
TO reproject data we use the `spTransform()` function which takes 
2 key arguments:

1. a spatial lines, polygons or points object (that contains crs information) and
2. a crs object which defines the CRS that we want to transform the data to.

NOTE: once again we are modifying the data. Think long and hard about 
what layers you want to reproject vs maintain the integrity of!

```{r}
# epsg 3395 - global mercator
# reproject to something different
gulf_study_area_wgs84 <- spTransform(gulf_study_area,
                                     CRSobj = crs(us_states))

```

Your map should look like the one below

```{r }
# plot data 
plot(coastlines_sim2, 
     main = "Coastlines with the NE state boundaries\n all data in the same CRS")
plot(us_states, 
     add = TRUE,
     col = "purple")
plot(gulf_study_area_wgs84, 
     add = TRUE,
     col = "red")
```

## Map spatial extents

Our map is looking better. But we may want to zoom in to our study 
area. We also know that some of our data (ie the coastlines) are 
particularly complex makign for slower render times. Let's crop 
our data to our study area extent to

1. make a "zoomed in" map and to
1. control the size of the data that we are working with by getting rid of data that we don't need. 

To crop the data - trimming or removing all of the data outside of our 
crop object, we will use the `crop()` function which takes 2 arguments

1. the data that you wish to crop
1. an extent object of an spatial object with an extent definition.


```{r}
# crop the coastlines data to the spatial extent of the gulf study
# area extent
coastlines_crop <- crop(x = coastlines, 
                        y = gulf_study_area_wgs84)
plot(coastlines_crop)
```

Now - it's your turn! Create a final study area map!
Adjust the colors and layers to make it look nice. If you are 
more interested in learning ggplot, feel free to work with ggplot.
If you'd like to use baseplot - feel free to use base.

Ggplot pros: templatted maps, easy to standardize, cleaner mapping code
base plot pros: faster maps, more difficult 

| Tool  | Pros   | Cons  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ggplot()  | templated maps, easy to standardize, clean mapping code, simple fast legends  | need to convert sp objects from `readOGR()` to a data frame |   
| BASE R plot()  | faster mapping, supports sp objects natively  | legends are tedious to create and customize |
|   |   |   |   
===

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(coastlines_crop, 
     main = "Coastlines with the NE state boundaries")
plot(us_states,
     add = TRUE,
     col = 'grey90')
plot(gulf_study_area_wgs84,
     add = TRUE,
     #col = "grey93", 
     border = "grey",
     lwd = 3)
```

## Leaflet 

Finally it is always nice to create interactive maps. This allows your 
colleagues to not only see but also interact with your data.
Let's use mapview() to create a quick interactive map.

To use mapview with multpile layers, you simply create a mapview 
object for each layer and then add them together to produce a final plot.
Note that mapview will take care of spatial extent for you! 

```{r}
# create mapview map with multiple layers
m_coast <- mapview(coastlines_crop)
m_states <- mapview(us_states)

m_coast + m_states
```


## Raster data in R

Next, let's work with some raster data in `R`. We use the `raster()` package
to open and manipulate raster data in `R`. This package has a large 
community around it and is a standard for most raster operations in `R`.


To load a raster layer with a single band - we use `raster()`.

![raster bands](https://earthdatascience.org/images/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-6/single_multi_raster.png)

A raster layer can have one or depending on the format more than 1 band of information stored within it. Sometimes those bands are for images (see below) and will be RGB or in the case of a multi or hyperspectral 
remote sensing instrument - hundreds of bands across the light spectrum.

Sometimes those bands will be time series (for example climate data which we will work with tomorrow).

![RGB raster bands ](https://earthdatascience.org/images/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-6/RGBSTack_1.jpg)

Below we will simply open a single band. The data format is .asc which 
is an ESRI format that is text based. ASC files contain a header where the key metadata are described. 

```xml

```

We can open an .asc layer using the raster() function. Note that this 
same process can be used with geotiffs and many other raster formats.
The raster package is adept at figuring out what format of data you are 
providing it and using the correct drivers to open and read in the data!

The raster package also has a wrapper around the base plot() function 
allowing us to plot data using the same approach that we used above!

```{r}
# load raster data in r
gulf_bathy <- raster("bathymetry/gom_bathy_srtm30plus_asc.asc")
plot(gulf_bathy)

```

Remove the box and axes.

```{r}
# remove the box and axes from the plot
plot(gulf_bathy,
     box = FALSE,
     axes = FALSE)
```

Adjust the colors.

```{r}
# remove the box and axes from the plot
plot(gulf_bathy,
     box = FALSE,
     axes = FALSE,
     col = grey(1:100/100),
     main = "grayscale bathymetric map")
```

# Hillshade of the gulf coast

```{r get-hillshade, eval=FALSE}
# get ocean bottom hillshade
download.file("http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/50m/raster/GRAY_50M_SR_OB.zip",
              destfile = "GRAY_50M_SR_OB.zip")
# unzip data
unzip("GRAY_50M_SR_OB.zip")
```

Plot the data .
```{r}
# plot data - adjust the color to be grayscale
hillshade <- raster("hillshade/GRAY_50M_SR_OB/GRAY_50M_SR_OB.tif")
plot(hillshade,
     col = grey(1:100/100))
```

If you don't want to crop your data - and simply want a quick plot
of a particular spatial area, you can use the `ext = ` argument 
with baseplot. 

Below we specify the spatial extent of the gulf_study_area object
that we used above to "zoom in" on just that area

```{r}
plot(hillshade,
     main = "Bathymetric data for the gulf coast",
     col = grey(1:100/100),
     axes = FALSE,
     box = FALSE,
     ext = extent(gulf_study_area_wgs84))

# add coastlines
plot(coastlines_crop, 
     add = TRUE)

```


Challenge -- Create a basemap of the gulf coast using the layers 
that we have been working with. On this map include

1. This hillshade as a base map
2. Coastline boundaries
3. US State boundaries

NOTE: use this time to create a basemap that your group can use. If you
have other layers that you'd like to use - go for it!

When you create your map, be sure to 

1. CROP the hillshade for quicker plotting
2. Experiment with the alpha argument to overlay a raster on top of a hillshade. Valid alpha values range between 0-1 (e.g. `alpha = .5`)

 
```{r}
plot(hillshade,
     main = "Bathymetric data for the gulf coast",
     col = grey(1:100/100),
     axes = FALSE,
     box = FALSE,
     ext = extent(gulf_study_area_wgs84))
# add coastlines
plot(coastlines_crop, 
     add = TRUE)
plot(gulf_bathy,
     add = TRUE,
     alpha = .5)
plot(us_states,
     add = TRUE)
```


## Static basemaps in R

You can also create static basemaps quickly in R. Below we use ggmap()
to create a basemap for a particular lat/long location.

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap")
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
```

Let's create a basemap!


https://earthdatascience.org/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-3/ggmap-basemap/

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get map
sq_map <- get_map(location = c(lon = -89.89, lat = 25.68),
                  maptype = "satellite",
                  source = "google", zoom = 5)

ggmap(sq_map)
```

Your turn -- try a different maptype

Hint: use ??get_map to find different options


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get map
sq_map <- get_map(location = c(lon = -89.89, lat = 25.68),
                  maptype = "terrain",
                  source = "google", zoom=5)

ggmap(sq_map)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get map
sq_map <- get_map(location = c(lon = -89.89, lat = 25.68),
                  maptype = "watercolor",
                  source = "stamen", zoom=5)

ggmap(sq_map)
```



## Chloropleth maps

Note that this section still has some bugs so we won't be using it for today's lessons.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

     us_states@data, 
     by="id")

us_states_data$HD01_VD <- as.numeric(us_states_data$HD01_VD)

library(scales)

ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = us_states_data, 
                        aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group))

                        aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill=HD01_VD), 
                        color = "black", size=0.2) + 
                        coord_fixed() +
                        scale_fill_distiller(type="seq", trans="reverse", palette = "Reds", breaks=pretty_breaks(n=10)) 
  

```


```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# need to figure out how to  
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = coastlines_crop, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(data = us_states_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(data = gulf_study_area_wgs84, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = "purple")) + 
  theme_bw() 


```

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# select all states that equal alabama 
texas <- us_states[us_states$NAME == "Texas",]
plot(texas)
```
