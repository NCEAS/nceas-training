## Topic

### Introduction
**Purpose:** In this lesson we will introduce some of the key concepts associated
with spatial data including:

* spatial extent
* resolution
* coordinate reference system

We will also define raster vs vector data structures.

**Background:**
Brief overview of topic and relationship to scientific synthesis.

**Explanation:**
No slide decks. Ideal to keep all materials within ecosystem. Use this single rmd as your mechanism to explain, show, lecture, or demo/use tutorial to explain concepts.

**Products for your open science portfolio:**
list what students will produce

### Learning outcomes

At the end of this 30 minute overview you will be able to:

1. Explain the difference between the raster vs vector data structures.
1. Define spatial extent, resolution, coordinate reference system.
1. List the 3 vector data structures.
1. List 2-3 R packages that can be used to work with spatial data.


## About raster data

About raster data:

* data are stored in a regular grid
* a value is associated with each grid cell (also called a pixel)
* each pixel represents a geographic area - in our case that is often an area on the earth

### Raster resolution

* The size of each pixel is referred to as **resolution**
* If pixels are smaller (represent a smaller area on the earth, they are considered HIGHER resolution) - in the example of an image, this makes the image look more 'crisp'

[raster resolution](http://earthdatascience.org/images/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-3/raster-resolution.png)


* if you have fewer pixels within a particular spatial extent, the resolution is LOWER
* if you have more pixels within a particular spatial extent, the resolution is HIGHER

## About vector data

[Intro to vector data EDS website ](http://earthdatascience.org/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-4/intro-vector-data-r/)
* discrete geometric locations
* x,y locations are vertices
* organization of those vertices determines structure: points, lines, polygons

## Vector data formats

* shapefile
* json, geojson
* text files
* others??


## Vector data spatial extent

The spatial extent of a vector **dataset** is determined by the min and max x,y location
of ALL OF THE SPATIAL OBJECTS stored in the dataset.

NOTE: the spatial extent of an individual object can also be quantified!

### Vector data attributes

* vector data can store attribute tables - when in a shapefile format, these look like excel spreadsheets where each object has an associated set of attributes.


[Attribute tables](http://earthdatascience.org/images/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-5/attribute_table.png)

in a geojson structure this may look like this:


```xml
[ {
  "station_name" : "SOUTH PLATTE RIVER AT COOPER BRIDGE NEAR BALZAC",
  "amount" : "262.00",
  "flag" : "na",
  "station_status" : "Gage temporarily anavailable",
  "county" : "MORGAN",
  "wd" : "1",
  "dwr_abbrev" : "PLABALCO",
  "data_source" : "Co. Division of Water Resources",
  "http_linkage" : {
    "url" : "http://www.dwr.state.co.us/SurfaceWater/data/detail_graph.aspx?ID=PLABALCO&MTYPE=DISCHRG"
  },
  "div" : "1",
  "date_time" : "2017-02-15T09:00:00",
  "stage" : "1.86",
  "usgs_station_id" : "06759910",
  "variable" : "DISCHRG",
  "location" : {
    "latitude" : "40.357498",
    "needs_recoding" : false,
    "longitude" : "-103.528053"
  },
  "station_type" : "Stream"
}
...
]
```
