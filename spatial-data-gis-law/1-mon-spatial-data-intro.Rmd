## Topic

### Introduction
**Time:** 30 minutes

**Purpose:** In this lesson we will introduce some of the key concepts associated
with spatial data including:

* Spatial extent
* Resolution
* Coordinate reference system

We will also define raster vs. vector data structures.

**Background:**
Often we need to use spatial data in our analysis - that is data that correspond
to some x,y (and z) location on the Earth. however, not all spatial data are
created the same. understanding the basic foundations of working with spatial
data will save you a lot of time when it comes to processing the data in tools
like R, QGIS and python!

### Learning outcomes

At the end of this 30 minute overview you will be able to:

1. Explain the difference between the raster vs vector data structures.
1. Define spatial extent, resolution, coordinate reference system.
1. List the 3 vector data structures (point, line, polygon).
1. List 2-3 `R` packages that can be used to work with spatial data.


## Getting started with R

## About raster data

About raster data:

* data are stored in a **regular grid**
* a value is associated with each grid cell (also called a pixel)
* each pixel represents a geographic area - in our case that is often an area on the earth

### Raster resolution

* The size of each pixel is referred to as **resolution**
* If pixels are smaller (represent a smaller area on the earth, they are considered HIGHER resolution) - in the example of an image, this makes the image look more 'crisp'
* if you have fewer pixels within a particular spatial extent, the resolution is LOWER
* if you have more pixels within a particular spatial extent, the resolution is HIGHER

### Raster spatial extent

The spatial extent of a raster refers to the area on the earth's surface that
the raster covers.

Note that the raster spatial extent relates directly to the
spatial resolution.

CHALLENGE question
1. If you have more pixels over the same spatial extent - will the image look sharper (more clear) or more blurry?
2. If you have fewer pixels over the same spatial extent...

## About vector data

[Intro to vector data - EarthDataScience.org ](http://earthdatascience.org/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-4/intro-vector-data-r/)

Attributes of vector data

* Discrete geometric locations
* x,y locations are vertices
* Organization of those vertices determines structure: points, lines, polygons

## Vector data formats

There are many different spatial vector data formats. Let's list a few:

* shapefile
* geojson
* text files
* others??

## Vector data spatial extent

The spatial extent of a vector **dataset** is determined by the min and max x,y location
of ALL OF THE SPATIAL OBJECTS stored in the dataset.

NOTE: the spatial extent of an individual object can also be quantified!

### Vector data attributes

Vector data often has associated attribute tables. When in a shapefile format,
these look like excel spreadsheets where each object has an associated set of
attributes.


![Attribute tables](http://earthdatascience.org/images/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-5/attribute_table.png)

in a geojson structure this may look like this:


```xml
[ {
  "station_name" : "SOUTH PLATTE RIVER AT COOPER BRIDGE NEAR BALZAC",
  "amount" : "262.00",
  "flag" : "na",
  "station_status" : "Gage temporarily anavailable",
  "county" : "MORGAN",
  "wd" : "1",
  "dwr_abbrev" : "PLABALCO",
  "data_source" : "Co. Division of Water Resources",
  "http_linkage" : {
    "url" : "http://www.dwr.state.co.us/SurfaceWater/data/detail_graph.aspx?ID=PLABALCO&MTYPE=DISCHRG"
  },
  "div" : "1",
  "date_time" : "2017-02-15T09:00:00",
  "stage" : "1.86",
  "usgs_station_id" : "06759910",
  "variable" : "DISCHRG",
  "location" : {
    "latitude" : "40.357498",
    "needs_recoding" : false,
    "longitude" : "-103.528053"
  },
  "station_type" : "Stream"
}
...
]
```

### CRS storage formats

* EPSG
* proj.4
* WKT
* others!!!
