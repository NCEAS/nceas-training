### Introduction
**Purpose:**


### Background:
Brief overview of topic and relationship to scientific synthesis.


### Learning outcomes

At the end of this 30 minute overview you will be able to:

* Add vector data to QGIS
* Add raster data to QGIS
* Explore the metadata - CRS, resolution, extent of a spatial data layer in QGIS
* Create a basic map in QGIS


## Intro to Quantum GIS (QGIS)

[QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) is a free and open GIS tool that can be used
across many different platforms. You can think of it as ESRI's ArcGIS but it plays
nicely with MACs and PC's!

QGIS is:

* Cross-platform
* Open source
* Free

QGIS is an ideal tool to explore  geospatial data. Naturally it can also be used
for geospatial processing and analysis however keep in mind that these workflows
can also be performed in R and Python and make even **more reproducible**! 

It is also possible to script QGIS analysis in Python.

# Visualize and explore spatial data

* Load raster, vector, and delimited coordinate data
* Adjust colors, symbols, transparency
* Select features, measure distances, and more


# Make maps

* Design map layouts
* Add legend, scale bar, labels, images

# Create data

* Digitize, edit, and save data


# Harness greater powers

* Interface to GRASS GIS
    - Full-fledged analytical GIS environment
* Run many GDAL/OGR utilities
    - Swiss army knife for geospatial data
