### Introduction
In this lesson we will learn how to perform some basic spatial analysis in 
`R`.  First we will review interpolation using the IDW interpolation method.

### Learning outcomes

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

1. Interpolate data using Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolator
1. Export a raster to geotiff format using `writeRaster()`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = 'hide')
```


```{r load-libraries}
# set working dir
setwd("~/Documents/data/oss-institute")
# load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(gstat)
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(rgeos)
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

First we open some point data. Here we have sea level elevation for the 
year 2000.

```{r}
# import csv file
sea_level_2000 <- read.csv("tues-data/sea_lev_2000.csv")

# view data structure
str(sea_level_2000)

# check out our data
sea_level_2000$elev_mm
```

Notice that we have some NA values (missing data values) in our data. 
Let's remove those

```{r}
# remove NA values 
sea_level_2000 <- sea_level_2000 %>% 
  drop_na()
```

Next, we will create a new object. We'll use _sp in the name as we 
will turn this object into a spatial object. Then we will make sure 
that we have a default x and y column that stores longitude and latitude
information respectively.


```{r}
# create spatial points object
sea_level_2000_sp <- sea_level_2000

# define x & y as longitude and latitude
sea_level_2000_sp$x <- sea_level_2000_sp$lon  
sea_level_2000_sp$y <- sea_level_2000_sp$lat
class(sea_level_2000_sp)
```

## Create spatial object

In the next series of steps we convert our data.frame object into a 
spatial object using the coordinates() function. Notice that 
we are using a different notation below to perform this.

`~x + y` simply tells R to use the x and y columns to respectively to 
convert a non spatial object into a spatial object. 

```{r}
coordinates(sea_level_2000_sp) <- ~x + y
```

Let's plot our data to see what it looks like.

```{r}
# view spatial points
plot(sea_level_2000_sp)

```

In the next setp, we will setup our interpolation. We will need to do the following:

1. we create an EMPTY grid across a spatial extent that we with to interpolate our data within 
1. We populate that grid with interpolated values generated from the points layer that we created above. 

In the example below, we use the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW)
interpolator. 

First, let's create our grid. We are going to use a random (in this case)
spatial extent to populate this grid. 
```{r}
##### IDW interpolation #####
# establish an extent within which you want to interpolate
# -99/24 to -80/32.
x_range <- as.numeric(c(-99, -80))  # min/max longitude of the interpolation area
y_range <- as.numeric(c(24, 32))  # min/max latitude of the interpolation area

# create an empty grid of values ranging from the xmin-xmax, ymin-ymax
grd <- expand.grid(x = seq(from = x_range[1], 
                           to = x_range[2], by = 0.1), 
                            y = seq(from = y_range[1],                                             to = y_range[2], by = 0.1))  # expand points to grid
class(grd)
```

Next we will convert this grid into a spatial points and then spatial 
pixels object.

```{r}
# Convert grd object to a matrix and then turn into a spatial 
# points object
coordinates(grd) <- ~x + y
# turn into a spatial pixels object
gridded(grd) <- TRUE

#### view grid with points overlayed
plot(grd, cex = 1.5, col = "grey")
plot(sea_level_2000_sp, 
       pch = 1, 
       col = "red", 
       cex = 1, 
       add = TRUE)
```

In the last step we use idw() to interpolate our points to a grid. 
idw() takes several arguments

1. first the formula: elev_mm ~ 1 tells r to use the x,y coordinates combined with the elev_mm value to perform the griding
1. locations = represents the spatial points objects that you wish to grid
1. newdata = represents the grid object that you will insert the values into
1. finally we specify the power. Generall power values range between 1-3 with a smaller number creating a smoother surface (stronger influence from surrounding points) and a larger number creating a surface that is more true to the actual data and in turn a less smooth surface potentially.


```{r}
# interpolate the data
idw_pow1 <- idw(formula = elev_mm ~ 1, 
           locations = sea_level_2000_sp, 
           newdata = grd,
           idp = 1)  

# Notice that the output data is a SpatialPixelsDataFrame 
class(idw_pow1)
# plot the data
plot(idw_pow1,
     col = terrain.colors(55))

```

```{r export-gtif, eval=FALSE}
# convert spatial pixels df to raster
idw_pow1_ras <- raster(idw_pow1)
# export to geotif
writeRaster(idw_pow1_ras,
            filename = "idw_pow1.tif", "GTiff")
```

Let's create a difference surface with a larger power. 

```{r}
# interpolate the data
idw_pow3 <- idw(formula = elev_mm ~ 1, 
           locations = sea_level_2000_sp, 
           newdata = grd,
           idp = 3)  

# plot the data
plot(idw_pow3,
     col = terrain.colors(55))
```


```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# assign lat/long (EPSG 4326 CRS) 
# here i copied from spatialreference.org
#crs(sea_level_2000_sp) <- CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0")
```


## Extract data from a raster in R

Sometimes we want to extract values from a raster dataset and assign them to 
points or polygons. In the GIS works (Arc and QGIS) we do this via zonal 
statistics. In the R world we can perform the same tasks using the extract function.

In this segment of the lesson, we will use a set of points. At each point we will
extract raster values from a buffer region around that point and calculate a 
summary stat (in this case a mean raster value). We will then plot the points 
on a map weighting the size according to relative mean value.  

![Extract data from a buffer](https://earthdatascience.org/images/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-5/buffer-circular.png)


To begin let's import some raster data. Note that the data are in `.asc` format.
Asc is a text based raster file format.

```{r export-shapefile}
# assign a CRS to data 
crs(sea_level_2000_sp) <- CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0")
# export as shapefile
writeOGR(sea_level_2000_sp,
          layer = 'sea_level_2000', 
          'tues-data/',
          driver = "ESRI Shapefile",
         overwrite_layer = TRUE)

```


```{r}
# import our study area layer
study_area <- readOGR("study-area/study-area.shp")
sea_level_2000 <- readOGR("tues-data/sea_level_2000.shp")

# import climate data - netcdf format
climate <- raster("climate/air.sfc.mon.mean.nc")

# reproject study area layer climate data 
climate_geog <- projectRaster(climate, 
                              crs = crs(study_area))

climate_geog_cr <- crop(climate_geog, 
                        study_area)
plot(climate_geog_cr)
plot(study_area, 
     add = TRUE)


```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
writeRaster(climate_geog_cr,
            filename = "tues-data/climate_geog_cr.tif",
            "GTiff")
```


Next we will extract bathymetry values for each point location. Rather than select
 a single value, we will create a circular BUFFER around each point and then 
 extract raster values that fall within that circle. FInally, we will calculate a 
 mean of all pixels values to create a final value.
 
 
```{r}
# Note that below will return a data.frame containing the max height
# calculated from all pixels in the buffer for each plot
climate_mean <- raster::extract(climate_geog_cr, # the raster that you wish to extract values from
                    sea_level_2000_sp, # a point, or polygon spatial object
                    buffer = .5, # specify a .5 degree radius
                    fun = mean, # extract the MEAN value from each plot
                    sp = TRUE) # create spatial object
```

Finally, we can plot the data. 

```{r}

plot(climate_geog_cr,
     main = "sample points sized by surface temperature")
plot(climate_mean,
     pch = 19, 
     # size the points according to the temp value
     cex = ((climate_mean$Monthly.air.temperature.at.Surface - 280)/10),
     add = TRUE)
```


```{r}
#Create a function to generate a continuous color palette
rbPal <- colorRampPalette(c('yellow', 'purple'))

#This adds a column of color values
# based on the y values
climate_mean$col <- rbPal(3)[as.numeric(cut(climate_mean$Monthly.air.temperature.at.Surface, breaks = 3))]

plot(study_area)
#plot(sea_level_2000_sp, add = TRUE)
plot(climate_mean,
     pch = 19, 
     # size the points according to the temp value
     cex = (((climate_mean$Monthly.air.temperature.at.Surface) - 280)/10),
     col = climate_mean$col,
     add = TRUE)
```
