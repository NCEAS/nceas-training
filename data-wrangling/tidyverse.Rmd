###Introduction
<b> Philosophy of tidyverse </b>
Tidy data make your life easier. Data strutures should match intuition and common sense. Data should have logical structure.  Rows are are observations, columns are variables. Tidy data also increase the viability that others can use your data, do better science, reuse science, and help you and your ideas survive and thrive. A workflow should also include the wrangling you did to get your data ready. If data are already very clean in a spreadsheet, they can easily become a literate, logical dataframe. Nonetheless, you should still use annotation within the introductory code to explain the meta-data of your data to some extent and what you did pre-R to get it tidy.  The philosophy here is very similar to the data viz lesson forthcoming with two dominant paradigms. Base R code functions, and pipes %>% and the logic embodied within the libraries associated with the the tidyverse. Generally, I prefer the tidyverse because it is more logical and much easier to remember.  It also has some specific functions needed to address common errors in modern data structures with little code needed to fix them up.

###Learning outcomes
1. To appreciate the differences between base R and tidyverse packages in terms of function and grammmar.  
2. To be able to use dplyr functions to wrangle data and solves common challenges in datasets.
3. To be able to check and address missing values.
4. To be able to grab part of a dataset.
5. To use pipes to move/wrangle chunks of your dataset.

###Key concepts listed

We will cover two basic challenges you will certainly encounter.  

###Exercise 1. Missing data
Missing data are typically termed NAs. Missing data are not necessarily the same as true zeros. See [Mixed Effects Models and Extension in Ecology with R](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-0-387-87458-6.pdf) for an excellent discussion of this. Missing data due to experimental design, observer error, or failures to detect a process are 'false zeros' and equivalent to missing data. True negatives (measured and detected absences) are recommended to be coded as a zero.

The read_csv from the tidyverse handles data import well, does not assume factors, and typically takes a parsimonous approach to vector interpretation. The analog from base R is read.csv but comes with many limitations.

```{r, missing data}
#Missing data. In error, missing cells/observations in some measure can kick back an error. In other apps, sometimes ignored but can introduce error.
#setwd('data-wrangling')
library(tidyverse)
ttc <-read_csv("data/ttc.csv") #The Toronto Transit Commission Data.
ttc #tibble produced if use read_csv versus dataframe. Tibbles include str() list of vector attributes at the top of output.

#check for missing values
is.na(ttc)
summary(ttc, na.rm=TRUE) #excludes NA
new.ttc <-na.omit(ttc) # returns without missing values
is.na(new.ttc) #check to see if it worked

#many other solutions but I use these two frequently

```

###Exercise 2. Selecting part of a dataset
Dplyr provides select (columns/vectors), filter (rows/observations), and now pull (returns a vector not df or tibble). Fantastic functions (and beasts) to wrangle out specifics or simplify your dataframe.

```{r, selections}
survey<-read_csv("data/5081.survey.1.csv")
survey
#I want just a simple tibble with experience by discipline for students new to rstats in a graduate-level course.

experience <- survey %>% select(discipline, r.experience)
experience

#Now I just want to select the physiology folks
physiologists <- experience %>% filter(discipline == "physiology")
physiologists

#Selections also often include a summary by levels or I want to make a new column with some calculations. Think about what you have likely done in excel.

#used pipes and made a nice summary table
experience <-survey %>% group_by(discipline) %>% summarise(
  count = n(),
  exp = mean (r.experience)
)

```

###Exercise 3. Updated dplyr package
To explore the Star Wars dataset within the tidyverse updated package dplyr 0.7.0 and make a new column.
Full details list on its own [blog](https://blog.rstudio.org/2017/06/13/dplyr-0-7-0/).

```{r loads, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- starwars #setup as tibble
data #quick look

#simplify species
data <- data %>% mutate(taxa = ifelse(species == "Droid", "machine", "biological"))
data <- data[!is.na(data$taxa), ] #remove NAs from one vector only

#note, ifelses are messy and easy to get really nested and long-winded. Dplyr 0.7.0 release notes suggests considering the function case_when in its stead.

#count up by gender
counts <- data %>% group_by(gender) %>% count()
counts <- counts[!is.na(counts$gender), ] #remove NAs from one vector only
counts$gender <- factor(counts$gender, levels = counts$gender[order(counts$n)])

#I love the count and tally functions! There is also now a new set of similar functions: add_count() and add_tally() for adding an n column within groups

```

<br>
**Data viz**
```{r viz, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#library(plotly)
p <- ggplot(data, aes(height, mass, color = taxa)) + geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
#ggplotly(p)
p


p <- ggplot(counts, aes(gender, n)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "forestgreen", width = 0.25) + coord_flip()
p

```

**Interpretation of the Star Wars dplyr verse**  
1. Basic data in 'starwars' data associated with dplyr 0.7.0 ideal for exploring functionality of tidyverse.  
2. Good wrangling opportunities including categorical simplifications, addressing c() within a vector such as the 'films' vector, working with NAs, and there are vectors to relate and using as grouping variables within plots/basic stats.  
3. Adequate complexity to offer for padawan and jedi alike.
