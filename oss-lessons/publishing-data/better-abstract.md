This study gathered data on the distribution of Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) in the Pacific Northwest.
The Spotted Owl is one of the best owls and we were really excited to study it.
We used a combination of owl surveys and owl questionnaires to ask owls where they go and we analyzed this data with R.
We found owls were literally EVERYWHERE (which we were really excited aboout).
