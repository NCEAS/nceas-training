COLUMN ,EXPLANATION,,,
study,these numbers came from the first 68 studies iniatilly selected in the Web of Science,,,
Reference,,,,
Case,Study number . Followed by case number,,,
Location ,State or province and country,,,
coordinate 1,"got from paper or, in cases where it was not provide, I used GoogleEarth to approximate localization ",,,
coordinate 2,"got from paper or, in cases where it was not provide, I used GoogleEarth to approximate localization ",,,
Region,geographical zone,,,
Climate,got from each paper,,,
Mean annual precipitation (mm),got from each paper,,,
MAP (2001-2009),"data are mean annual precipitattion (mm) calculated from monthly averages for every month, 2001-2009. They're at 25km resolution.Â  So represent prevailing climate, not local conditions.",,,
NDVI (aster),"Aster based NDVI data. It represents the local NDVI. The exact location of each study was identified using the coordenates,description of the location and the vegetation provided by the study. As better as possible, I tried to sample only the part of the gradient studied in each study.",,,
NDVI,"MODIS-based NDVI data. They are the sum of all months for each year and then the mean annual NDVI. They were calculated from monthly averages for every month, 2001-2009. IMPORTANT: the NDVI are of limited meaning for these narrow, coastal features.",,,
Soilwet,"data are mean annual soilwet calculated as sum of all months for each year. They were calculated from monthly averages for every month, 2001-2009. They're at 25km resolution. Unit: kg/m2, which is equivalent to mm depth. The model used for this only includes the top two meters of the soil column, so a soilwet figure like 350 would mean that there were 350mm of equivalent water depth in the first 2,000 mm of soil depth.

part of the gradient,The name used by the authors,,,
gradient 2,"In order to standardize in some way the gradient I called 1) the first portion, where there isn't wood plants, 2) portion where wood is present but the herbs is still dominant and 3) forests.",,,
Study type,experimental or pattern,,,
Performance estimator,plant response,,,
Performance estimator2,"in this column all estimators were classified in one of the following categories: survival, emergency, occurrence, abundance, biomass, richness, growth or reproductive",,,
SGH test?,"If the paper, in someway, tested the Stress Gradient Hypoyhesis",,,
Study mechanism?,"If, somehow, the authors investigated possible mechanisms of facilitation. ",,,

Neighbor life-form,,,,
Neighbor species,,,,
Target life-form,,,,
Target species,,,,
Target ontogenetic phase,,,,
Balance interaction,,,,
OBS,,,,
Main Hypothesis or Question,,,,
data usable for Meta?,"If the authors provide the essential data to calculate the effect size. If no, there is an explanation of why. Two possibilities: 1) the data are usable but the authors didn't provide something important, like sample size or 2) The data are not usable because, for exemple, they don't have a true control",,,
ask the authors?,"If the anwser in previous question was 1 the anwser here is YES (I mean, since the data is usable but is not available we need to ask the authors). On the other hand, if the anwser for the previous was 2 we should NOT ask nothing to the authors since the data is not usable. NA when the previuos anwer was yes.",,,
